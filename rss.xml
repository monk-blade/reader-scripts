<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>PIN code</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>The 75th Independence Day coincides with another milestone in the country’s history — it was on August 15, 1972, that the Postal Index Number (PIN) was introduced in India.</p>
<p>As the PIN code turns 50 on Monday, we look at its history and evolution.</p>
<h4>Why was the PIN code introduced?</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to the Department of Posts, there were 23,344 post offices, primarily in urban areas, in India at the time of Independence.</li>
<li>But, the country was growing rapidly and the postal network had to keep pace.</li>
<li>The PIN code was meant to ease the process of mail sorting and delivery in a country where different places, often, have the same or similar names, and letters are written in a wide variety of languages.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does the PIN code work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The PIN is made up of six digits.</li>
<li>The first number indicates the postal region — Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern; and number 9, which signifies the Army Postal Service.</li>
<li>The second number denotes a sub-region, and the third represents the sorting district.</li>
<li>The remaining numbers narrow the geography further to the specific post office making the delivery.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who was the person behind the initiative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The person behind the initiative was <strong><u>Shriram Bhikaji Velankar</u></strong>, additional secretary in the Union Ministry of Communications and a senior member of the Posts and Telegraphs Board.</li>
<li>Velankar was also a Sanskrit poet of eminence who had been conferred the President’s Award for Sanskrit in 1996, three years before he died in Mumbai.</li>
<li>He had set up a cultural group in Mumbai, called the Dev Vani Mandiram, which worked to create awareness about Sanskrit in India and foreign countries.</li>
<li>Velankar was also the chairman of the World Philatelic Exhibition, called Indipex, which was held in New Delhi in 1973 and featured 120 countries.</li>
<li>He retired from his government service on December 31, 1973.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are some parallel systems followed world over?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Globally, in the US, the Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code was introduced July 1, 1963, under the aegis of the Postal Service Nationwide Improved Mail Service plan to improve the speed of mail delivery.</li>
<li>Under the old system letters went through about 17 sorting stops – the new system was going to be considerably less time-consuming utilizing newer, more mechanical systems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is the PIN code still relevant?</h4>
<ul>
<li>With the spread of the Internet, when people are sending fewer letters, it is easy to question the relevance of the PIN code.</li>
<li>But try to order food delivery or a parcel over online shopping and the importance of Velankar’s work in India will become evident.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Freedom fighters in news</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>In his Independence Day address to the nation the Prime Minister paid tributes to women freedom fighters for showing the world the true meaning of India’s “nari shakti”. A look at the women he named in his speech:</p>
<h4>Rani Laxmibai</h4>
<ul>
<li>The queen of the princely state of Jhansi, Rani Laxmibai is known for her role in the First War of India’s Independence in 1857.</li>
<li>Born Manikarnika Tambe in 1835, she married the king of Jhansi.</li>
<li>The couple adopted a son before the king’s death, which the British East India Company refused to accept as the legal heir and decided to annex Jhansi.</li>
<li>Refusing to cede her territory, the queen decided to rule on behalf of the heir, and later joined the uprising against the British in 1857.</li>
<li>Cornered by the British, she escaped from Jhansi fort. She was wounded in combat near Gwalior’s Phool Bagh, where she later died.</li>
<li>Sir Hugh Rose, who was commanding the British army, is known to have described her as “personable, clever…and one of the most dangerous Indian leaders”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Jhalkari Bai</h4>
<ul>
<li>A soldier in Rani Laxmibai’s women’s army, Durga Dal, she rose to become one of the queen’s most trusted advisers.</li>
<li>She is known for putting her own life at risk to keep the queen out of harm’s way.</li>
<li>Till date, the story of her valour is recalled by the people of Bundelkhand, and she is often presented as a representative of Bundeli identity.</li>
<li>According to Ministry of Culture’s Amrit Mahotsav website, “Many Dalit communities of the region look up to her as an incarnation of God and also celebrate Jhalkaribai Jayanti every year in her honour.”</li>
</ul>
<h4>Durga Bhabhi</h4>
<ul>
<li>Durgawati Devi, who was popularly known as Durga Bhabhi, was a revolutionary who joined the armed struggle against colonial rule.</li>
<li>A member of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, she helped Bhagat Singh escape in disguise from Lahore after the 1928 killing of British police officer John P Saunders.</li>
<li>During the train journey that followed, Durgawati and Bhagat Singh posed as a couple, and Rajguru as their servant.</li>
<li>Later, as revenge for the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev, she made an unsuccessful attempt to kill the former Punjab Governor, Lord Hailey.</li>
<li>Born in Allahabad in 1907 and married to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) member Bhagwati Charan Vohra, Durgawati, along with other revolutionaries, also ran a bomb factory in Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rani Gaidinliu</h4>
<ul>
<li>Born in 1915 in present-day Manipur, Rani Gaidinliu was a Naga spiritual and political leader who fought the British.</li>
<li>She joined the Heraka religious movement which later became a movement to drive out the British. She rebelled against the Empire, and refused to pay taxes, asking people to do the same.</li>
<li>The British launched a manhunt, but she evaded arrest, moving from village to village.</li>
<li>Gaidinliu was finally arrested in 1932 when she was just 16, and later sentenced for life. She was released in 1947.</li>
<li>Then PM Nehru described Gaidinliu as the “daughter of the hills”, and gave her the title of ‘Rani’ for her courage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rani Chennamma</h4>
<ul>
<li>The queen of Kittur, Rani Chennamma, was among the first rulers to lead an armed rebellion against British rule.</li>
<li>Kittur was a princely state in present-day Karnataka.</li>
<li>She fought back against the attempt to control her dominion in 1824 after the death of her young son. She had lost her husband, Raja Mallasarja, in 1816.</li>
<li>She is seen among the few rulers of the time who understood the colonial designs of the British.</li>
<li>Rani Chennamma defeated the British in her first revolt, but was captured and imprisoned during the second assault by the East India Company.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Begum Hazrat Mahal</h4>
<ul>
<li>After her husband, Nawab of Awadh Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled after the 1857 revolt, Begum Hazrat Mahal, along with her supporters, took on the British and wrested control of Lucknow.</li>
<li>She was forced into a retreat after the colonial rulers recaptured the area.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Velu Nachiyar</h4>
<ul>
<li>Many years before the revolt of 1857, Velu Nachiyar waged a war against the British and emerged victorious. Born in Ramanathapuram in 1780, she was married to the king of Sivagangai.</li>
<li>After her husband was killed in battle with the East India Company, she entered the conflict, and won with support of neighbouring kings.</li>
<li>She went on to produce the first human bomb as well as establish the first army of trained women soldiers in the late 1700s.</li>
<li>Her army commander Kuyili is believed to have set herself ablaze and walked into a British ammunition dump.</li>
<li>She was succeeded by her daughter in 1790, and died a few years later in 1796.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Maximum Residue Limit (MRL)</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>Amid reports that several samples of basmati rice contained the residue of certain pesticides above the maximum residue level (MRL), the Punjab government has decided to ban the use of 10 formulations.</p>
<h4>Which are the chemicals banned?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The State government believed that the sale, stock distribution, and use of Acephate, Buprofezin, Chloropyriphos, Methamidophos, Propiconazole, Thiamethoxam, Profenofos, Isoprothiolane, Carbendazim, and Tricyclazole was not in the interest of basmati rice growers.</li>
<li>It is said that there is a risk of breaching the MRL fixed by the competent authority for basmati rice.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL)?</h4>
<ul>
<li>MRL is the highest level of pesticide residue that is legally tolerated in or on food or feed when pesticides are applied correctly in accordance with Good Agricultural Practice promulgated by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</li>
<li>The MRL is usually determined by repeated (on the order of 10) field trials at an appropriate pre-harvest interval or withholding period has elapsed.</li>
<li>For many pesticides, this is set at the Limit of determination (LOD) – since only major pesticides have been evaluated and understanding of acceptable daily intake (ADI) is incomplete.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>CARA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Child Adoption</p></div></div><p>A report recently tabled on “Review of Guardianship and Adoption Laws” in Parliament has stated that- India despite a country with millions of orphans, there are only 2,430 children available for adoption.</p>
<h4>What is the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are many enthusiastic parents who are ready to adopt children.</li>
<li>To address this paradox, a Parliamentary panel has recommended district-level surveys to proactively identify orphaned and abandoned children.</li>
<li>According to the report, there were 27,939 prospective parents registered with the Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) as on December 2021, up from nearly 18,000 in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is CARA?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is an autonomous and statutory body of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. It was set up in 1990.</li>
<li>It functions as the nodal body for the adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate in-country and inter-country adoptions.</li>
<li>CARA is designated as the Central Authority to deal with inter-country adoptions in accordance with the provisions of the 1993 Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption, ratified India in 2003.</li>
<li>It primarily deals with the adoption of orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children through its associated and recognized adoption agencies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Adoption Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>The eligibility of prospective adoptive parents living in India, duly registered on the <strong>Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System (CARINGS)</strong>, irrespective of marital status and religion, is Procedure for adoption adjudged by<strong> specialised adoption agencies</strong> preparing home study reports.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The specialized adoption agency then secures court orders approving the adoption.</li>
<li>All <strong>non-resident persons</strong> approach authorized adoption agencies in their foreign country of residence for registration under CARINGS.</li>
<li>Their eligibility is adjudged by authorised foreign adoption agencies through home study reports.</li>
<li>CARA then issues a pre-adoption ‘no objection’ certificate for foster care, followed by a court adoption order.</li>
<li>A final <strong>‘no objection’ certificate from CARA</strong> or a conformity certificate under the adoption convention is mandatory for a passport and visa to leave India.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What else regulates child adoption?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><u>Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015</u></strong> permits the <strong><u>adoption of same-sex children</u></strong>, allowing biological or adopted parents to adopt a child of the same gender.</li>
<li>A single or divorced person can adopt under the JJ Act, but a single male cannot adopt a girl child.</li>
<li>According the <strong><u>Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (HAMA)</u></strong>, a Hindu parent or guardian can place a child for adoption with another Hindu parent under the Act.</li>
<li>A prospective parent can also adopt a male child if he has no other male children or grandchildren, or a female child if he has no other female children or grandchildren.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with child adoption in India</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parent-centrism:</strong> The current adoption approach is very parent-centred, but parents must make it child-centred.</li>
<li><strong>Age of child:</strong> Most Indian parents also want a child between the ages of zero and two, believing that this is when the parent-child bond is formed.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional issues:</strong> Because the ratio of abandoned children to children in institutionalised care is lopsided, there are not enough children available for adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Lineage discrimination:</strong> Most Indians have a distorted view of adoption because they want their genes, blood, and lineage to be passed down to their children.</li>
<li><strong>Red-tapism:</strong> Child adoption is also not so easy task after the Juvenile Justice Rules of 2016 and the Adoption Regulations of 2017 were launched.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>CAG Audit, CRZ norms</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>This week, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India tabled a report in Parliament on whether steps taken by the Union Environment Ministry to conserve India’s coastal ecosystems have been successful.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The CAG frequently undertakes ‘performance audits’ of government programmes and ministries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Centre’s obligations on conserving the coastline</h4>
<ul>
<li>The government has issued notifications under the <strong><u>Environment Protection Act, 1986</u></strong>, to regulate activities along India’s coasts particularly regarding construction.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>Coastal Regulation Zone Notification (CRZ), 2019</u></strong> implemented by the Ministry, <strong><u>classifies the coastal area into different zones</u></strong> to manage infrastructure activities and regulate them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three institutions responsible for the implementation of the CRZ are:</p>
<ol>
<li>National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) at the <strong><u>Centre</u></strong>,</li>
<li>State/Union Territory Coastal Zone Management Authorities (SCZMAs/UTCZMAs) in every <strong><u>coastal State and Union Territory</u></strong></li>
<li>District Level Committees (DLCs) in <strong><u>every district</u></strong> that has a coastal stretch and where the CRZ notification is applicable</li>
</ol>
<h4>Functions under CRZ rules</h4>
<ul>
<li>These bodies examine if CRZ clearances granted by the government are as per procedure, if project developers are once given the go-ahead are complying with conditions and if the project development objectives under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Programme (ICZMP) are successful.</li>
<li>They also evaluate the measures taken up by the government towards achieving the targets under Sustainable Development Goals.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why did the CAG undertake this audit?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The CAG has a constitutional mandate to investigate and report on publicly funded programmes.</li>
<li>The CAG conducted “pre-audit studies” and found that there were large-scale CRZ violations in the coastal stretches.</li>
<li>Incidences of illegal construction activities (reducing coastal space) and effluent discharges from local bodies, industries and aquaculture farms had been reported by the media and this prompted it to undertake a detailed investigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What did the recent audit find?</h4>
<p>The audit pointed out <strong><u>various categories of violations</u></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were instances of the Expert Appraisal Committees —who evaluate the feasibility of an infrastructure project and its environmental consequences — not being present during project deliberations.</li>
<li>There were also instances of the members of the EAC being fewer than half of the total strength during the deliberations.</li>
<li>The SCZMA had <strong><u>not been reconstituted</u></strong> in Karnataka and there was delayed reconstitution in the States of Goa, Odisha and West Bengal.</li>
<li>The DLCs of Tamil Nadu lacked participation from local traditional communities. In Andhra Pradesh, DLCs were not even established.</li>
<li>There were instances of <strong><u>projects being approved despite inadequacies</u></strong> in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) reports.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What problems did the CAG find in the States?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of strategy:</strong> Tamil Nadu didn’t have a strategy in place to conserve the Gulf of Mannar Islands.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of monitoring:</strong> In Goa, there was no system for monitoring coral reefs and no management plans to conserve turtle nesting sites.</li>
<li><strong>No scientific oversight:</strong> In Gujarat, instruments procured to study the physiochemical parameters of soil and water of the inertial area of the Gulf of Kutch weren’t used.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring issues:</strong> Sea patrolling in Gahirmatha Sanctuary, in Kendrapara, Odisha did not happen.</li>
<li><strong>No information in public domain:</strong> There was no website to disseminate the information related to the NCZMA, the CAG found, which is a clear violation of the mandated requirements of the Authority.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What lies ahead?</h4>
<ul>
<li>These reports are placed before the Standing Committees of Parliament, which select those findings and recommendations that they judge to be the most critical to public interest and arrange hearings on them.</li>
<li>In this case, the Environment Ministry is expected to explain omissions pointed out by the CAG and make amends.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India</h4>
<ul>
<li>The CAG is the Constitutional Authority, established under Article 148 of the Constitution of India.</li>
<li>They are empowered to Audit all receipts and expenditure of the GoI and the State Governments, including those of autonomous bodies and corporations substantially financed by the Government.</li>
<li>The CAG is also the statutory auditor of Government-owned corporations.</li>
<li>It conducts supplementary audit of government companies in which the Government has an equity share of at least 51 per cent or subsidiary companies of existing government companies.</li>
<li>The reports of the CAG are laid before the Parliament/Legislatures and are being taken up for discussion by the Public Accounts Committees (PACs) and Committees on Public Undertakings (COPUs).</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>Five years after the Supreme Court’s five-judge Bench under then CJI J.S. Khehar invalidated instant triple talaq in August 2017, the women petitioners continue to live a life of half-divorcees.</p>
<h4>What is triple talaq?</h4>
<ul>
<li>‘Triple Talaq’ is a procedure of divorce under the Sharia Law which is a body of the Islamic law.</li>
<li>Under this, a husband can divorce his wife by pronouncing ‘Talaq’ thrice.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court invalidated instant triple talaq in the Shayara Bano versus the Union of India case while refraining from commenting on the state of their marriages directly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What was the issue all about?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The case dates back to 2016 when the Supreme Court had sought assistance from the then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on pleas challenging the <strong><u>constitutional validity of “triple talaq”.</u></strong></li>
<li>The hearing also included cases of <strong>“nikah halala” </strong>and<strong> “polygamy”</strong>, to assess whether Muslim women face gender discrimination in cases of divorce.</li>
<li>The issue gained political momentum on March 2017 when the Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the Supreme Court that <strong>the issue of triple talaq falls outside the judiciary’s realm.</strong></li>
<li>However, on August 22, the Supreme Court set aside the decade-old practice of instant triple talaq saying it was<strong> <u>violative of Article 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why was triple talaq abolished?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In spite of protests by Muslim women and activists world-wide the procedure was <strong><u>most prevalent throughout the country.</u></strong></li>
<li>There are several instances where ‘triple talaq’ has enabled husbands to <strong><u>divorce arbitrarily, devoid of any substantiation.</u></strong></li>
<li>Oral talaq or ‘triple talaq’ <strong><u>delivered through social media platforms</u></strong> like Skype, text messages, email and WhatsApp have become an increasing cause of worry for the community.</li>
<li>The ‘triple talaq’ has been <strong><u>abolished in 21 countries including Pakistan</u></strong>, but is still prevalent in India.</li>
<li>The Centre reasons that these practices are <strong><u>against constitutional principles</u></strong> such as gender equality, secularism, international laws etc.</li>
<li>When these practices are <strong><u>banned in Islamic theocratic countries</u></strong>, the practices could have absolutely no base in religion and are only prevalent to permit the dominance of men over women.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why in news now?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half-divorce:</strong> Technically still married, practically divorced, they enjoy no conjugal rights nor receive any regular maintenance from the estranged husbands.</li>
<li><strong>Cannot remarry:</strong> Practically abandoned, the women cannot remarry in the absence of a legally valid divorce.</li>
<li><strong>No legal action:</strong> After the verdict, none of the men were visited by law enforcement bodies and told to take back their wives.</li>
<li><strong>No legal implementation:</strong> Further, no arrests could be made for giving instant triple as the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 came into force long after the pronouncement of instant talaq.</li>

<p>Much recently, Sri Lanka approved the arrival of a Chinese satellite-tracking vessel to its southern Chinese-funded Hambantota port.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>India has raised concerns over the ship’s visit.</li>
<li>Caught in a delicate diplomatic and geopolitical spot, <strong><u>Colombo gave its nod despites India’s requests to deny the permission.</u></strong></li>
<li>It is asserted that <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/sansad-tv-perspective-the-sri-lankan-default/">bankrupt Sri Lanka</a> succumbed to Chinese pressure after <strong><u>initially refusing</u></strong> the ship to dock.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Yuan Wang 5: The vessel</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yuan Wang 5 was described by the Sri Lankan government as a “scientific research ship”.</li>
<li>The BRISL (Belt &amp; Road Initiative Sri Lanka), a Colombo-based organisation studying China’s ambitious connectivity project, was the first to draw attention to the visit.</li>
<li>It said that the Yuan Wang 5 will conduct “satellite control and research tracking in the northwestern part of the Indian Ocean Region”.</li>
<li>Vessels of the Yuan Wang class are said to be used for tracking and supporting satellite as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles by the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force.</li>
</ul>
<h4>India’s reaction</h4>
<ul>
<li>India has expressed its concern over the Chinese vessel visit.</li>
<li>It is carefully monitoring any development having a bearing on its security and economic interests.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How have other countries reacted?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The developments showed that Colombo was caught between the U.S. and India on the one hand, and China on the other.</li>
<li>That too at a time when the Sri Lankan government is counting on all their support as the island nation, hit by a devastating economic crisis, embarks on debt restructuring ahead of a promised IMF package.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did China respond?</h4>
<ul>
<li>China reacted strongly at Sri Lanka, following concerns voiced by India.</li>
<li>It clarified that Sri Lanka is a transportation hub in the Indian Ocean.</li>
<li>Scientific research vessels from various countries including China have made port calls in Sri Lanka for replenishment.</li>
<li>Secondly, it invoked Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and the right to develop relations with other countries based on its development interests.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is Sri Lanka’s stand?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is reported that the US and Indian envoys were asked to provide concrete reasons for their objections.</li>
<li>Not satisfied with the reasons being sufficient to refuse entry to the Chinese vessel, SL decided to inform the Chinese embassy in Colombo to inform the ship to continue its journey to Hambantota.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Inclusive growth, Social justice</p></div></div><h4><strong>Context </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Key findings of the World Inequality Report 2022 related to India: National Income: In India, the top 10% and top 1% hold respectively 57% and 22% of total national income.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is inclusive growth?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines Inclusive growth as the economic growth that is distributed fairly across society and creates opportunities for all. It refers to ‘broad-based’, ‘shared’, and ‘pro-poor growth’.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is social justice?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities. Social workers aim to open the doors of access and opportunity for everyone, particularly those in greatest need.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Meaning of Inclusiveness</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Inclusiveness is a concept that encompasses equity, equality of opportunity, and protection in market and employment transitions and is, therefore, an essential ingredient of any successful growth strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Need of inclusive growth </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete development</strong>: India is the 7th largest by area and 2nd by population and 12th largest economy at market exchange rate. Yet, India is away from the development<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Income inequality</strong>: Low agriculture growth, low quality employment growth, low human development, rural-urban divides, gender and social inequalities, and regional disparities etc. are the problems for the nation.</li>
<li><strong>Human development: </strong>Reducing poverty and inequality and increasing economic growth are the main aim of the country through inclusive growth<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Need of social justice </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equality</strong>: We should shift from equality of outcomes to equality of opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Peace and Order</strong>: If the majority disregards smaller sections in the community, it drives them to rebellion.</li>
<li><strong>Dignity</strong>: To ensure life to be meaningful and liveable with human dignity.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigate Sufferings: </strong>It is a dynamic device to mitigate the sufferings of the poor, weak Dalits, tribal and deprived sections of the society.</li>
<li><strong>Human Resources</strong>: It will help in the conservation of human resource by provision of health and education facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom to form political</strong>, economic or religious institutions: It will help to eradicate the challenges of caste system, untouchability and other discrimination in the society.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Challenges before inclusive growth and social justice </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wage Gap: </strong>When it comes to wages in the workplace, there is a noticeable differentiation between men and women. According to the American Association of University Women (AAUW), in 2018, the gender pay gap from men and women for the same job was 82 percent. Stated simply, women make 82 percent of what men make doing the same work. This can be further broken down into a pay gap for minority men and women.</li>
<li><strong>LGBTQ Oppression: </strong>When it comes to oppression and human rights, individuals of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Queer (LGBTQ) community face several forms of social injustice and oppression. For example, same sex marriages are outlawed in some states and countries. Additionally, transsexual students often face discrimination and bullying within school settings.</li>
<li><strong>Education System: </strong>Globally, steps are being made to close the education gap between male and female students. However, there are still several areas around the world where girls may never set foot into a classroom at all. UNESCO notes that more than nine million girls never go to school, compared to only six million boys in areas of Africa.</li>
<li><strong>Child Welfare: </strong>Social workers and human rights activists are working tirelessly to combat issues relating to children and their welfare. Despite their efforts, there are still several problems children face that are harmful to their health and mental wellbeing.</li>
<li><strong>Forced Child Labour</strong>: Laws are in place around the world to ensure a safe work environment for children. These laws were drafted from historically harsh and dangerous working conditions for children. While many would like to believe that child labour is a thing of the past, it persists in some areas around the globe.</li>
<li><strong>Child Abuse and Neglect</strong>: Thousands of children globally are being neglected. They’re also being physically, sexually and emotionally abused. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that as many as a quarter of adults have been abused as children. This abuse has both social and economic impacts that include mental health problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Government measures to address this challenge </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>SETU(Self Employment and Talent Utilization)</li>
<li>Skill India</li>
<li>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)</li>
<li>Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana</li>
<li>MUDRA (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency)Bank</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Equality of opportunity is the core of inclusive growth, and the inclusive growth emphasises to create employment and other development opportunities through rapid and sustained economic growth, and to promote social justice and the equality of sharing of growth results by reducing and eliminating inequality of opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p>Explain the term inclusive growth in brief. How we can achieve social justice through inclusive growth?</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>While India celebrates its 75th year of Independence, it also <strong>celebrates 60 years</strong> of diplomatic relations with the European Union (EU).</li>
<li>A cooperation agreement signed in 1994 took the bilateral relationship beyond trade and economic cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Definition </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Relations between the European Union and the Republic of India are currently defined by <strong>the 1994 EU–India Cooperation Agreement.</strong> The EU is a significant trade partner for India and the two sides have been attempting to negotiate <strong>a free trade</strong> deal since 2007.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Common roadmap and shared vision</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The road map highlights engagement across five domains: foreign policy and security cooperation; trade and economy; sustainable modernisation partnership; global governance; and people-to-people relations.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Brief history </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India-EU relations date to the early 1960s, with India being amongst the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community.</li>
<li>At the 5th India-EU Summit at The Hague in 2004, the relationship was upgraded to a <strong>‘Strategic Partnership’.</strong></li>
<li>The two sides adopted <strong>a Joint Action Plan</strong> in 2005 (which was reviewed in 2008) that provided for strengthening dialogue and consultation mechanisms in the political and economic spheres, enhancing trade and investment, and bringing peoples and cultures together.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is strategic partnership?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A ‘strategic partnership’, as the term suggests, involves a shared understanding between the two or more states involved on the nature of threats in the environment and the place of their collective power in helping mitigate the threats.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why they are important?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As the world’s two largest democracies, the EU and India share a commitment to protecting and promoting human rights, a rules-based global order, effective multilateralism, sustainable development and open trade.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Significance </strong></h4>
<p>[A] <strong>Political Partnership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Joint Political Statement signed in 1993, opened the way for annual ministerial meetings and a broad political dialogue.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>Cooperation Agreement signed in 1994</u></strong> took the bilateral relationship beyond trade and economic cooperation.</li>
<li>A multi-tiered institutional architecture of cooperation has since been created, presided over by the <strong><u>India-EU Summit since 2000</u></strong><strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Today EU stands as a major reference for India’s legislative process in the field of <strong><u>Data security and privacy.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>[B] <strong>Economic Ties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bilateral trade</strong>: The EU is India’s largest trading partner, while India is the EU’s 9<sup>th</sup> largest trading partner. It is the second-largest destination for Indian exports after the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong>: The EU’s share in foreign investment inflows to India has more than doubled from 8% to 18% in the last decade. This makes the EU an important foreign investor in India.</li>
<li><strong>Preferential treatment</strong>: India is the benefactor of the unilateral preferential tariffs under the EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP).</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: Both sides have finalised civil nuclear cooperation agreement after 13 years of negotiations called as the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). It involves collaboration in the civil nuclear energy sector.</li>
<li><strong>Development cooperation:</strong><strong> </strong>Over €150 million worth of projects by EU are currently ongoing in India. European Investment Bank (EIB) is providing loans for Lucknow, Bangalore, and Pune Metro Projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>[C] <strong>Defence &amp; Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EU and India have instituted several mechanisms for greater cooperation on pressing security challenges like <strong><u>counterterrorism, maritime security, and nuclear non-proliferation</u></strong><strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region in New Delhi (IFC-IOR) has recently been linked-up with the Maritime Security Centre – Horn of Africa (MSC-HOA) established by the EU Naval Force (NAVFOR).</li>
</ul>
<p>[D] <strong>Climate Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EU and India also underline their highest political commitment to the<strong> <u>effective implementation of the Paris Agreement</u> </strong>and the UNFCCC despite US withdrawing from the same.</li>
<li><strong><u>India-EU Clean Energy and Climate Partnership</u></strong> was agreed at the 2016 Summit – to promote access to and disseminate clean energy and climate friendly technologies and encourage R&amp;D.</li>
<li><strong><u>Energy cooperation</u></strong> is now ongoing on a broad range of energy issues, like smart grids, energy efficiency, offshore wind and solar infrastructure, and research and innovation.</li>
<li>EU and India also cooperate closely on the <strong><u>Clean Ganga initiative</u></strong> and deal with other water-related challenges in coordinated manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>[E] <strong>Research and Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India-EU Science &amp; Technology Steering Committee meets annually to review scientific cooperation.</li>
<li>Both have official mechanisms in fields such as Digital Communications, 5G technology, Biotechnology, artificial intelligence etc.</li>
<li>ISRO has a long-standing cooperation with the European Union, since 1970s. It has contributed towards the <strong><u>EU’s satellite navigation system Galileo</u></strong><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Future scope </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade figures and Investments</strong>: Bilateral trade between the two surpassed $116 billion in 2021-22. The EU is India’s second largest trading partner after the U.S., and the second largest destination for Indian exports.</li>
<li><strong>Job creation</strong>: There are 6,000 European companies in the country that directly and indirectly create 6.7 million jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Green strategic partnership:</strong> between India and Denmark aims to address climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and the India-Nordic Summit focused on green technologies and industry transformation that are vital for sustainable and inclusive growth.</li>
<li><strong>Energy security</strong>: Energy serves as an important aspect of the relationship between India and the EU. Given the impacts of climate change, this aspect has become extremely crucial today. Both entities have been pursuing cooperation for the joint development of clean energy.</li>
<li><strong>Political cooperation</strong>: India and the EU may benefit from increasing cooperation in the resolution of issues such as terrorism and radicalization, cyber-security, coordinating on certain key and relevant aspects of foreign policy, and other humanitarian issues.</li>
<li><strong>International support</strong>: It is crucial that Europe recognize India as a partner for peace that is committed to human rights, both regionally and internationally.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Challenges before them </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadlock over BTIA</strong>: The negotiations for a Broad-based Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) were held between 2007 to 2013 but have remained dormant/suspended since then.</li>
<li><strong>Export hurdles</strong>: Indian demands for ‘Data secure’ status (important for India’s IT sector) to ease norms on temporary movement of skilled workers, relaxation of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS), etc. stands largely ignored.</li>
<li><strong>Trade imbalance</strong>: This heavily leans towards China. India accounts for only 1.9% of EU total trade in goods in 2019, well behind China (13.8%).</li>
<li><strong>Brexit altercations</strong>: In the longer term of balancing of global powers, a smaller Europe without the key military and economic force UK, is much weaker in the wake of an ambitious China and an increasingly protectionist US.</li>
<li><strong>EU primarily remains a trade bloc:</strong> This has resulted in a lack of substantive agreements on matters such as regional security and connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Undue references to sovereign concerns</strong>: The European Parliament was critical of both the Indian government’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in 2019 and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.</li>
<li><strong>China’s influence</strong>: EU’s affinity lies with China. This is because of its high dependence on the Chinese market. It is a major partner in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</li>
<li><strong>Ukrainian war</strong>: EAM S. Jaishankar’s witty reply about EU’s oil import from Russia has not been welcomed across the EU. It still expects India to criticize Russia.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way forward </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A close bilateral relation between India and the EU has far-reaching economic, political and strategic implications on the crisis-driven international order.</li>
<li>Both sides should realise this potential and must further the growth of the bilateral ties with a strong political will.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question</strong></p>
<p>What do you understand by the term strategic partnership? India and EU are celebrating 60 years of diplomatic relations trace their journey with significance and challenges in their ties.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Seventy-five years ago, India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru made these remarks in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0HvWuCiPZ4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stirring speech on India attaining freedom at midnight</a>: “The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?”</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Nehru’s vision for India </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Nehru’s vision of India was anchored in a set of ideas such as democracy, secularism, inclusive economic growth, free press and non-alignment in international affairs and also in institutions that would lay the foundation for India’s future growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Leadership of Nehru after independence </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1947, Nehru, as Prime Minister, inherited an India that was politically shattered, socially divided and emotionally devastated. Yet, with restraint and self-confidence, he steered the country through those turbulent times and laid out the vision of a modern, progressive nation that quietly earned the respect of the global community.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Temple of modern India </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bhakra-Nangal Dam: </strong>The Bhakra-Nangal Dam project is a series of multi-purpose dams that were among the earliest river valley developments schemes undertaken by the government of India after independence. The project, though, had been conceived long before independence.</li>
<li><strong>Bhilai Steel Plant</strong>: Bhilai, located in Chhattisgarh, was home to massive iron-ore deposits at Dalli Rajhara. Taking this into consideration, the government of India and the USSR entered into an agreement which was signed on March 2nd 1955, at New Delhi.</li>
<li><strong>Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</strong>: The Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET), was started by the government of India on January 3rd 1954 with the intention of consolidating all research and development activities for nuclear reactors and technology under the Atomic Energy Commission.</li>
<li><strong>Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)</strong>: to support indigenous scientists like Boshi Sen, who is credited with producing hybrid maize and irradiated wheat mutant.</li>

<h4><strong>Relevance of these institutions </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Development</strong>:Economic development mainly depends upon industrial development. Heavy &amp; basic industries like iron &amp; steel, shipping, mining, etc. are required for supplying raw materials to small industries.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Development</strong>:Private sector usually neglect backward area. But public sector organizations set up their units in economically backward areas. By this public sector removes regional imbalance &amp; brings regional development.</li>
<li><strong>Employment</strong>:Various public sectors operating in India needs lot of manpower &amp; this provide employment to unlimited individuals according to their education, experience &amp; abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Service Motive</strong>: Public sector organizations are working with the only motive of providing public utility services to society at large irrespective of profit.</li>
<li><strong>Sound Infrastructure</strong>:Rapid industrial growth in a country needs sound infrastructure. Infrastructural industries require huge capital for construction of Roads, Railways, Electricity &amp; many such industries. Private sector is unable to have such huge capital &amp; that also without any high return but public sector can easily afford to provide all infrastructural facilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Some challenges they face today </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inefficient Management: </strong>It has been found that these enterprises are managed by public savants. They are not professionally qualified nor experts in the management of industrial enterprises.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Efficiency: </strong>They are not run on commercial principles. Their main motto is social welfare, not profit earning.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Innovations</strong>: Innovations are essential for economic development. Public enterprise lacks it due to monopoly or lack of competition. The private sector is always busy with innovating new techniques, new production methods, etc. For the purpose of cost reduction and profit maximization.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Some suggestions to address the challenges </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sound business principles</strong>: The enterprise should be run on sound business principles. There should be focus on improving efficiency in all functional areas. Policies, systems and procedures should be modified with the aim of making the enterprise flexible, efficient and profitable.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Public enterprises should have considerable autonomy in their functioning. Authority should be delegated and they should have the freedom to take decisions. Autonomy would ensure that decisions are taken at the right time and growth opportunities utilized in the best possible manner.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom from political interference</strong>: Many public enterprises are considered to be the kingdoms of politicians. They are run to suit the needs and requirements of the ruling party.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Today, opinions are divided about the iconic leader. While Nehru always had his critiques even back in the day, a significant section of the masses despise the dynasty politics of the Congress that ensued after his passing in 1964.</li>
<li>However, his contributions to India’s freedom, and as a Prime Minister to his country are acknowledged by people both within and outside India. His shortcomings do not take away from the legacy he cemented as a propagator for freedom, and as the free nation’s first Prime Minister.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p>Assess the Nehruvian legacy of public sector. Do you think they are still relevant today? While discussing challenges they face what suggestion will you give to improve their performance.</p></blockquote>

<h4></h4>
<h4><strong><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-621970" height="250" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/power.jpeg" width="333"/>Context </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) power distribution companies (DISCOMs) subscribed to the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) scheme introduced by the Central government to reduce their liability to generators in a phased manner over the next 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are discoms?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power distribution companies </strong>collect payments from consumers against their energy supplies (purchased from generators) to provide necessary cash flows to the generation and transmission sectors to operate.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is UDAY scheme? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana is the financial turnaround and revival package for electricity distribution companies of India initiated by the Government of India with the intent to find a permanent solution to the financial mess that the power distribution is in.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS)? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The revamped power distribution sector scheme aims to: Improve operational efficiencies, financial sustainability of discoms and power departments. Provide financial assistance to discoms. Modernise and strengthen distribution infrastructure. Improve reliability and quality of supply to the end consumers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Low performance of Discoms</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1) On the basis of AT&amp;C losses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A key metric to measure the performance of discoms is<strong> AT&amp;C losses.</strong></li>
<li>The UDAY scheme had envisaged bringing down these losses to <strong>15 per cent by 2019.</strong></li>
<li>However, as per data on the UDAY dashboard, the AT&amp;C losses <strong>currently stand at 21.7 per cent at the all-India level.</strong></li>
<li>In the case of the<strong> low-income north and central-eastern states</strong> — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh — the losses are considerably higher.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) On the basis of cost and revenue per unit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On another metric — the gap between discoms costs and revenues — the difference, supposed to have been eliminated by now, <strong>stands at Rs 0.49 per unit</strong> in the absence of regular and commensurate tariff hikes.</li>
<li>For the<strong> high-income southern states</strong> of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana,<strong> this gap between costs and revenues is significantly higher.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are the factors responsible for inefficiencies?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1) Electrification push without cost restructuring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government’s push for ensuring electrification of all have contributed to<strong> greater inefficiency.</strong></li>
<li> To support higher levels of electrification, cost structures need to be reworked, and the distribution network would need to be augmented —<strong> in the absence of all this, losses are bound to rise</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Economic fallout of the pandemic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With demand from <strong>industrial and commercial users</strong> falling, revenue from this stream, which is used to <strong>cross-subsidise other consumers,</strong> has declined, exacerbating the stress on discom finances.</li>
<li>A turnaround in the economy will provide some relief, but will not form the basis of a sustained improvement in finances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Lack of consumer data and metering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Even six years after UDAY was launched, various levels in the distribution chain — the feeder, the distribution transformer (DT) and the consumer — have not been fully metered.</li>
<li>As a result, it is difficult to ascertain the level in the chain where losses are occurring.</li>
<li>Other than discoms in metros like Delhi and Mumbai, there is also <strong>limited data on which consumer is attached to which DT.</strong></li>
<li>This lack of data makes it difficult to isolate and identify loss-making areas and <strong>take corrective action.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4) No tariff hike</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The continuing absence of political consensus at the state level <strong>to raise tariffs</strong> or to bring down AT&amp;C losses signal a lack of resolve to tackle the issues plaguing the sector.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Suggestions to improve the situation </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single discom:</strong> One of the solution centres around a national power distribution company.</li>
<li><strong>Financial adjustment</strong>: Another option is to deduct discom dues, owed to both public and private power generating companies, from state balances with the RBI forcing states to take the necessary steps to fix discom finances.</li>
<li><strong>National Open Access Registry (NOAR):</strong> NOAR is a centralized online platform through which the short-term open access to the inter-state transmission system is being managed in India.</li>
<li><strong>Promote privatization</strong>: Since in an earlier policy statement the government had mentioned that privatization of discoms is to be promoted, it would make sense to consider this transitional support as a catalyst.</li>
<li><strong>Provide transitional financial support</strong>: An alternate approach that could be considered by the Centre (in lieu of such assistance schemes) is providing only transitional financial support to all discoms, which are privatized under the private-public partnership mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="font-size: 32px; letter-spacing: -0.0415625em; font-family: 'Inter var', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Conclusion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuously subsidising discoms for their AT&amp;C losses (operational inefficiencies), and for not supplying power at commensurate tariffs to low-income households and agricultural customers (for political considerations) will become fiscally untenable.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.There</strong><strong> is growing demand for one nation one grid in this context Discuss the problems faced by various discoms. Suggest some robust solutions to address these problems sustainably.</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Senior scientist Nallathamby Kalaiselvi was appointed the director general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), on Saturday, August 6, 2022. This makes her the <strong>first woman to head the largest research and development organisation in India</strong>, which runs 38 laboratories and institutes, 39 outreach centres, and <strong>three innovation centres. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is CSIR?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, abbreviated as CSIR, was established by the Government of India in September 1942 as an autonomous body that has emerged as the largest research and development organisation in India.</li>
<li>CSIR covers a wide spectrum of science and technology – from oceanography, geophysics, chemicals, drugs, genomics, biotechnology and nanotechnology to mining, aeronautics, instrumentation, environmental engineering and information technology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who established it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar</strong></li>
<li>He was the Founder Director (and later first Director-General) of CSIR who is credited with establishing twelve national laboratories. He played a significant role in the building of post-independent Science and Technology infrastructure and in the formulation of India’s S &amp; T policies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CSIR’s Vision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Pursue science which strives for global impact, technology that enables innovation – driven industry and nurture trans-disciplinary leadership thereby catalyzing inclusive economic development for the people of India”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why CSIR is important?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Regarding intellectual property, the CSIR has over 2971 patents filed internationally with 1592 patents filed in India. Since its inception in 1942 over 14000 patents have been granted worldwide. It was awarded the National Intellectual Property Award in 2018 by the India Patent Office.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic handling</strong>: CSIR identified the unmet needs, assessed its strengths and capabilities for addressing the pandemic and adopted a <strong>multi-pronged strategy</strong> of working on diagnostics, surveillance, drugs, hospital assistive devices, personal protective equipment and supply chain and logistics. This strategy is now beginning to yield exciting solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contribution of CSIR </strong></p>
<p><strong>Strategic Sector</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head-Up-Display (HUD) </strong>In high-tech areas, CSIR-NAL made significant contribution by developing indigenous Head-Up- display(HUD) for Indian Light Combat Aircraft, Tejas. HUD aids the pilot in flying the aircraft and in critical flight maneuvers including weapon aiming.</li>
<li><strong>Design and Development of Indigenous Gyrotron: Addressing the challenges of technology denial:</strong>Design and development of indigenous gyrotron for nuclear fusion reactor has been accomplished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy &amp; Environment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solar Tree: </strong>On July 22<sup>nd</sup>a solar tree designed by CSIR- CMERI lab in Durgapur was  launched which occupies minimum space to produce clean power.</li>
<li><strong>Wax Deoiling Technology:</strong>Technology developed for recovery of wax developed in collaboration with Engineers India Limited (EIL) and Numaligarh Refinery Ltd., (NRL). Country’s largest wax producing (50,000 metric ton) plant has been commissioned at NRL with investment of over Rs 600 crore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value added Agriculture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medicinal and Aromatic Plants:</strong>Enhanced cultivation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants in the country brought about through development of new varieties and agro-technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Samba Mahsuri Rice Variety – Bacterial Blight Resistant:</strong>CSIR has in collaboration with DRR (ICAR) and DBT part funding developed an improved bacterial blight resistant Samba Mahsuri variety.</li>
<li><strong>Rice Cultivar (Muktashree) for Arsenic Contaminated Areas:</strong>A rice variety has been developed which restricts assimilation of Arsenic within permissible limit. The variety has been released to farmers of West Bengal.</li>
<li><strong>White-fly resistant Cotton variety:</strong>Developed a transgenic cotton line which is resistant to whiteflies. It is expected to render it commercially cultivable in 10 years, after due regulatory clearances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JD Vaccine for Farm Animals:</strong>Vaccine developed and commercialized for Johne’s disease affecting Sheep, Goat, Cow and Buffalo so as to immunize them and increase milk and meat production.</li>
<li><strong>Plasma Gelsolin Diagnostic Kit for Premature Births, and Sepsis related Deaths:</strong>A new kit is being developed to diagnose pre-mature birth and sepsis.</li>
<li><strong>Genomics and other omics technologies for Enabling Medical Decision – GOMED</strong>: Genetic diseases, though are individually rare, cumulatively affect a large number of individuals. A programme called GOMED (Genomics and other omics technologies for Enabling Medical Decision) has been developed by the CSIR which provides a platform of disease genomics to solve clinical problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>  Food &amp; Nutrition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ksheer-scanner: </strong>The Ksheer Scanner, a new technological invention by CSIR-CEERI detects the level of milk adulteration and adulterants in 45 seconds at the cost of 10 paise,</li>
<li><strong>Double-Fortified Salt:</strong>Salt fortified with iodine and iron having improved properties developed and tested for addressing anaemia in people. To be launched in the market soon.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-obesity DAG Oil:</strong>Oil enriched with Diacylglycerol (DAG) instead of conventional triacylglycerol (TAG) developed. To be launched in the market soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aquifer Mapping of Water Scarce Areas: </strong>Heliborne transient electromagnetic and surface magnetic technique based aquifer mapping carried out in six different geological locations in Rajasthan (2), Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Special Properties of the Ganga Water:</strong>Assessment of Water Quality &amp; Sediment Analysis of Ganga from different parts being done.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the challenges faced for sustainable growth of R&amp;D in India are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low research professionals</strong>: India has an estimated full-time equivalent R&amp;D professional strength of only 150 professionals per million, compared to that of other countries.</li>
<li><strong>Low investment</strong>: Indian research is mostly skewed towards basic research and lacks in application oriented R&amp;D. The vast majority of organizations would rather go for quick acquisition of technology rather than invest in internal R&amp;D.</li>
<li><strong>IPR enforcement</strong>: Inadequate enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR). While India has improved its IPR regime, the protection of intellectual property remains weak in some areas owing to inadequate laws and ineffective enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some positive suggestions to improve innovation </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embrace technology: </strong>Technologies, such as machine learning, can be used to improve R&amp;D decision-making. Documents need to be filed throughout the R&amp;D process, for example, and the process could be automated to free up employees to do more complex tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in innovation hubs</strong>: Companies that invest in innovation hubs expand talent and relationships with local universities and startups can support a two-way learning process and faster innovation cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting startups</strong>: Most radical innovations are coming from startups and more of them are needed. Tilting higher education towards science and encouraging more students to take degrees in science-based subjects can provide the people needed for R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>India is a strong contender in the field of Global R&amp;D. For India to derive maximum growth and sustainability of R&amp;D, its R&amp;D fundamentals have to be strong and excellent.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.Culture of innovation is needed in national growth in this context discuss what is IPR regime? How CSIR has helped to consolidate it?</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>According to NITI Aayog, “600 million people in India face high to extreme water stress with nearly 70% of water being contaminated; <strong>India is placed at 120th amongst 122 countries in the water quality index”.</strong></li>
<li>The latest <strong>global environmental ranking </strong>by Yale and Columbia Universities puts India at the <strong>bottom</strong> among 180 countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is development?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Economic development means different things to different people. On a broad scale, anything a community does to foster and create a healthy economy can fall under the auspice of economic development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is sustainability?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The integration of environmental health, social equity and economic vitality in order to create thriving, healthy, diverse and resilient communities for this generation and generations to come. The practice of sustainability recognizes how these issues are interconnected and requires a systems approach and an acknowledgement of complexity.</li>
<li>Sustainability is the balance between the <strong>environment, equity, and economy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What sustainability do for us?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable practices support ecological, human, and economic health and vitality.</li>
<li>Sustainability presumes that <strong>resources are finite</strong>, and should be used conservatively and wisely with a view to long-term priorities and consequences of the ways in which resources are used.</li>
<li>In simplest terms, <strong>sustainability is about our children and our grandchildren</strong>, and the world we will leave them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition of carrying capacity of earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carrying capacity</strong>: Carrying capacity is the <strong>maximum number of a species an environment can support indefinitely</strong>. Every species has a carrying capacity, even humans. The species population size is limited by environmental factors like adequate food, shelter, water, and mates. If these needs are not met, the population will decrease until the resource rebounds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mother earth has reached its carrying capacity now </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No species has altered the Earth’s natural landscape the way humans have.</li>
<li>Global climate change, mass extinction, and overexploitation of our <strong>global commons</strong> are all examples of the ways in which humans have altered the natural landscape.</li>
<li>Our growing population, coupled with rising affluence and <strong>per capita impact</strong>, is driving our planet closer to its tipping point.</li>
<li>With population expected to reach <strong>5 billion by 2050</strong>, many wonder if our natural resources can keep up with our growing demands.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Enrich your mains answer with this</strong></p>
<p>8 Billion dreams, ambitions, aspirations and only one earth to support them all . Human population, now nearing 8 billion, cannot continue to grow indefinitely. There are limits to the life-sustaining resources earth can provide us. In other words, there is a carrying capacity for human life on our planet.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Development vs environment issues </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment</strong>: For India, the national context is shaped by high youth unemployment, millions more entering the workforce each year, and a country hungry for substantial investments in hard infrastructure to industrialise and urbanise.</li>
<li><strong>Growth with low emission footprint</strong>: India’s economic growth in the last three decades, led by growth in the services sector, has come at a significantly lower emissions footprint.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: But in the coming decades, India will have to move to an investment-led and manufacturing-intensive growth model to create job opportunities and create entirely new cities and infrastructure to accommodate and connect an increasingly urban population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why a Carbon Fee and Dividend is Imperative</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that we will soon pass the limit on carbon emissions, because it requires decades to replace fossil fuel energy infrastructure with carbon-neutral and carbon negative energies.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What could India do to pursue an industrialization pathway that is climate-compatible?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A coherent <strong>national transition strategy</strong> is important in a global context where industrialised countries are discussing the imposition of carbon border taxes while failing to provide developing countries the necessary carbon space to grow or the finance and technological assistance necessary to decarbonise.</li>
<li>What India needs is an overarching <strong>green industrialisation strategy</strong> that combines laws, policy instruments, and new or reformed implementing institutions to steer its decentralised economic activities to become climate-friendly and resilient.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Railways conducted a test run of its longest freight train, Super Vasuki, with 295 loaded wagons carrying over 27,000 tonnes of coal.</p>
<h4>Super Vasuki</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 3.5-km-long freight train covered the distance of about 267 km between Korba in Chhattisgarh and Rajnandgaon in Nagpur.</li>
<li>It was run by the South East Central Railway (SECR).</li>
<li>The Railways plans to use this arrangement (longer freight trains) more frequently, especially to transport coal in peak demand season to prevent fuel shortages in power stations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Feats achieved</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the longest and heaviest freight train ever run by the Indian Railways.</li>
<li>The train takes about four minutes to cross a station.</li>
<li>The amount of coal carried by Super Vasuki is enough to fire 3,000 MW of power plant for one full day.</li>
<li>This is three times the capacity of existing railway rakes (90 cars with 100 tonnes in each) that carry about 9,000 tonnes of coal in one journey.</li>

<p>India’s ambitious project to translocate African cheetahs has missed an unofficial deadline of August 15.</p>
<h4>Asiatic Cheetah</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal was declared extinct in India in 1952.</li>
<li>The Asiatic cheetah is classified as a “critically endangered” species by the IUCN Red List, and is believed to survive only in Iran.</li>
<li>It was expected to be re-introduced into the country after the Supreme Court lifted curbs for its re-introduction.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Distribution of cheetahs in India</h4>
<ul>
<li>Historically, Asiatic cheetahs had a very wide distribution in India.</li>
<li>There are authentic reports of their occurrence from as far north as Punjab to Tirunelveli district in southern Tamil Nadu, from Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west to Bengal in the east.</li>
<li>Most of the records are from a belt extending from Gujarat passing through Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha.</li>
<li>There is also a cluster of reports from southern Maharashtra extending to parts of Karnataka, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</li>
<li>The distribution range of the cheetah was wide and spread all over the subcontinent. They occurred in substantial numbers.</li>
<li>The cheetah’s habitat was also diverse, favouring the more open habitats: scrub forests, dry grasslands, savannahs and other arid and semi-arid open habitats.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What caused the extinction of cheetahs in India?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The major reasons for the extinction of the Asiatic cheetah in India:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Reduced fecundity and high infant mortality in the wild</li>
<li>Inability to breed in captivity</li>
<li>Sport hunting and</li>
<li>Bounty killings</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is reported that the Mughal Emperor Akbar had kept 1,000 cheetahs in his menagerie and collected as many as 9,000 cats during his half-century reign from 1556 to 1605.</li>
<li>The cheetah numbers were fast depleting by the end of the 18th century even though their prey base and habitat survived till much later.</li>
<li>It is recorded that the last cheetahs were shot in India in 1947, but there are credible reports of sightings of the cat till about 1967.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conservation objectives for their re-introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Based on the available evidence it is difficult to conclude that the decision to introduce the African cheetah in India is based on science.</li>
<li>Science is being used as a legitimising tool for what seems to be a politically influenced conservation goal.</li>
<li>This also in turn sidelines conservation priorities, an order of the Supreme Court, socio-economic constraints and academic rigour.</li>
<li>The issue calls for an open and informed debate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues in re-introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experts find it difficult whether the African cheetahs would find the sanctuary a favorable climate as far as the abundance of prey is concerned.</li>
<li>The habitat of cheetahs is needed to support a genetically viable population.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Talaq-e-hasan</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Triple talaq and related issue</p></div></div><p>The Supreme Court has prima facie observed that the Muslim personal law practice of talaq-e-hasan is “not so improper”.</p>
<h4>What is Talaq-e-hasan?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Talaq-e-hasan is a form of divorce by which a Muslim man can divorce his wife by pronouncing talaq once every month over a three-month period.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why did the apex court say this?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The SC Bench said a Muslim woman has the option to divorce by the process of khula by returning the dower (mahr) or something else that she received from her husband or without returning anything.</li>
<li>This can be as per agreed by the spouses or Qadi’s (court) decree depending on the circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Petitioner’s contention</h4>
<ul>
<li>The petitioner argued that talaq-e-hasan and other forms of <strong><u>unilateral extra-judicial divorce</u> </strong>is an evil plague similar to sati.</li>
<li>Talaq-e-hasan is <strong><u>arbitrary, irrational and contrary to Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25</u></strong> and international conventions on civil rights and human rights, the petition submitted.</li>
<li>There should be a <strong><u>gender neutral, religion neutral, uniform grounds of divorce</u></strong> and uniform procedure of divorce for all citizens, it read.</li>
<li>The petitioner argued that the practice in question was “neither harmonious with the modern principles of human rights and gender equality <strong><u>nor an integral part of Islamic faith</u></strong>”.</li>
<li>The practice <strong><u>discriminates against Muslim women</u></strong> as they cannot resort to it against their husbands.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The apex court, while striking down triple talaq in the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/five-years-after-sc-verdict-talaq-petitioners-living-as-half-divorcees/">Shayara Bano case</a>, did not address the issue of talaq-e-hasan.</li>
<li>The unilateral practice of divorce was is definitely defies morality.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Ethanol blended petrol (EBP) Program</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>E-vehicles, Green technologies</p></div></div><p>Prime Minister has announced that India has achieved its target of blending 10% sugarcane-extracted ethanol in petrol, ahead of schedule.</p>
<h4>What is ethanol blending?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Blending ethanol with petrol to burn less fossil fuel while running vehicles is called ethanol blending.</li>
<li>Ethanol is an agricultural by-product which is mainly obtained from the processing of sugar from sugarcane, but also from other sources such as rice husk or maize.</li>
<li>Currently, 10% of the petrol that powers your vehicle is ethanol.</li>
<li>Though we have had an E10 — or 10% ethanol as policy for a while, it is only this year that we have achieved that proportion.</li>
<li>India’s aim is to increase this ratio to 20% originally by 2030 but in 2021, when NITI Aayog put out the ethanol roadmap, that deadline was advanced to 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why need ethanol blending?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ethanol blending will help bring down our share of oil imports (almost 85%) on which we spend a considerable amount of our precious foreign exchange.</li>
<li>Secondly, more ethanol output would help increase farmers’ incomes.</li>
<li>India’s net import of petroleum was 185 million tonnes at a cost of $55 billion in 2020-21.</li>
<li>A successful ethanol blending programme can save the country $4 billion per annum.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are first-generation and second-generation ethanols?</h4>
<ul>
<li>With an aim to augment ethanol supplies, the government has allowed procurement of ethanol produced from other sources besides molasses — which is first-generation ethanol or 1G.</li>
<li>Other than molasses, ethanol can be extracted from materials such as rice straw, wheat straw, corn cobs, corn stover, bagasse, bamboo and woody biomass, which are second-generation ethanol sources or 2G.</li>
<li>While inaugurating the Indian Oil Corporation’s (IOC) 2G ethanol plant last week, PM referred to not only the prospect of higher farmer income but also dwelt upon the advantages of farmers selling the residual stubble — left behind after rice is harvested — to help make biofuels.</li>
<li>This means lesser stubble burning and therefore, lesser air pollution.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How have other countries fared?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Though the U.S., China, Canada and Brazil all have ethanol blending programmes, as a developing country, Brazil stands out.</li>
<li>It had legislated that the ethanol content in petrol should be in the 18-27.5% range, and it finally touched the 27% target in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does it impact the auto industry?</h4>
<ul>
<li>At the time of the NITI Aayog report in June last year, the industry had committed to the government to make all vehicles E20 material compliant by 2023.</li>
<li>This meant that the petrol points, plastics, rubber, steel and other components in vehicles would need to be compliant to hold/store fuel that is 20% ethanol.</li>
<li>Without such a change, <strong><u>rusting</u></strong> is an obvious impediment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are there other alternatives?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Auto industry prefer the use of biofuels as the next step, compared to other options such as electric vehicles (EV), hydrogen power and compressed natural gas.</li>
<li>This is mainly because biofuels demand the least incremental investment for manufacturers.</li>
<li>Even though the industry is recovering from the economic losses bought on by the pandemic, it is bound to make some change to comply with India’s promise for net-zero emissions by 2070.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the challenges before the industry when it comes to 20% ethanol blended fuel?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Key challenge is the <strong><u>optimisation of engines for higher ethanol blends</u></strong> and the conduct of durability studies on engines and field trials before introducing E20 compliant vehicles.</li>
<li><strong><u>Storage</u></strong> is going to be the main concern, for if E10 supply has to continue in tandem with E20 supply, storage would have to be separate which then raises costs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sources for ethanol in India</h4>
<p>The plan was to divert its excess sugar production to produce ethanol, 3.5 million tonnes in 2021-22 and 6 million tonnes the next year, in addition to grains like rice, corn, and barley.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using surplus rice:</strong> The government’s food department revealed its plans to divert 17 million tonnes of surplus rice from its food stocks of 90 million tonnes to produce ethanol.</li>
<li><strong>Sugarcane:</strong> This is in addition to the 2 million tonnes of sugar which is already being diverted to produce ethanol.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How would this benefit the country?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost saving:</strong> A successful biofuels programme can save India $4 billion or about ₹30,000 crore every year by lowering import of petroleum products.</li>
<li><strong>Emission cut:</strong> Ethanol is also less polluting and offers equivalent efficiency at a lower cost than petrol.</li>
<li><strong>Biofuel’s policy boost:</strong> Rising production of grains and sugarcane and feasibility of making vehicles compliant to ethanol-blended fuel makes its biofuels policy a strategic requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Early rollout:</strong> Towards this, govt has put in place interest subsidies for distilleries to expand capacity while auto firms have agreed to make compatible vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the unintended effects of the policy?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsustainability of cash-crops:</strong> Increasing reliance on biofuels can push farmers to grow more water-intensive crops like sugarcane and rice.</li>
<li><strong>Huge water requirement:</strong> Currently use 70% of the available irrigation water, negating some positive impact on the environment of using more ethanol.</li>
<li><strong>Food and nutrition security:</strong> The move could impact India’s hunger situation by limiting the coverage of the food security schemes.</li>
<li><strong>Food inflation:</strong> Diversion of mass consumption grains can also push food prices up.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How will it impact crop diversification?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monotonous crops:</strong> Although the biofuels policy stresses on using less water-consuming crops, farmers prefer to grow more sugarcane and rice due to price support schemes.</li>
<li><strong>Water stress:</strong> Growing more of them can lead to an adverse impact in water-stressed areas in states.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What about food security?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is unethical to use edible grains to produce ethanol in a country where hunger is rampant.</li>
<li>India is already a poor performer in Global Hunger Index.</li>
<li>Although about 80 crore people are now receiving subsidized food grains, calculations show that over 10 crore eligible households are still excluded.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Public Estimates Committee</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Revenue loss to govt</p></div></div><p>The opposition has questioned the government over the corporate tax cut that led to a revenue loss of ₹1.84 lakh crore to the public exchequer as per a report of the Parliamentary Committee on Estimates.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Public Estimates Committee found such a huge revenue loss for the government.</li>
<li>The middle class was charged at a peak tax rate of 30% against 22% for the corporates. Quiet antithetical!</li>
<li>The centre on the other hand has repeatedly claimed that the corporate tax cut would help increase tax collection.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is Corporate Tax?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Domestic as well as foreign companies are liable to pay corporate tax under the Income-tax Act.</li>
<li>While a domestic company is taxed on its universal income, a foreign company is only taxed on the income earned within India i.e. is being accrued or received in India.</li>
<li>For the purpose of calculation of taxes under Income tax act, the types of companies can be defined as under:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Domestic Company </strong>is one which is registered under the Companies Act of India and also includes the company registered in the foreign countries having control and management wholly situated in India. A domestic company includes private as well as public companies.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Company</strong> is one which is not registered under the company’s act of India and has control &amp; management located outside India.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Why has the government slashed Corporate Tax?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The corporate tax cut is part of a series of steps taken by the government <strong><u>to tackle the slowdown in economic growth</u></strong> since the start of pandemic.</li>
<li>The most immediate reason behind the tax cut may be the <strong><u>displeasure that various corporate houses have shown against the government’s policies.</u></strong></li>
<li><strong><u>Many investors</u></strong>, for instance, were spooked by the additional taxes on them that were announced by the government during the budget in July and <strong><u>began pulling money out of the country</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The government hoped that the new, <strong><u>lower tax rates will attract more investments</u></strong> into the country and help <strong><u>revive the domestic manufacturing sector</u></strong> which has seen lackluster growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Corporate Tax?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The corporate tax rate is a major determinant of <strong><u>how investors allocate capital across various economies.</u></strong></li>
<li>So there is constant pressure on governments across the world to offer the lowest tax rates in order to attract investors.</li>
<li>Tax cuts, by putting more money in the hands of the private sector, can offer people more incentive to produce and contribute to the economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Impact of the rate cut</h4>
<ul>
<li>The present cut in taxes can <strong><u>make India more competitive on the global stage</u></strong> by making Indian corporate tax rates comparable to that of rates in East Asia.</li>
<li>At the same time, if it manages to sufficiently revive the economy, the <strong><u>present tax cut can help boost tax collections and compensate for the loss of revenue</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong> Relief to big companies</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Big companies got a relief of close to 10 percentage points in the effective tax rate including cess and surcharge.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong> Enhanced competitiveness</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>India was earlier at disadvantage because of a couple of factors and on top of it was the high corporate tax rate.</li>
<li>After this cut, base corporate tax rate in India has become competitive and should help boost investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Enhanced EoDB</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore with 17 per cent tax rate, and Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Taiwan with 20 per cent base tax rates are the only countries offering lower rates than India</li>
<li>India is now much better than China in terms of rate, transparency, and tax administration so companies can now look at India for setting up new units.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Criticisms of the move</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some see the present tax cut simply as a <strong><u>concession to corporate houses</u></strong> rather than as a structural reform that could boost the wider economy.</li>
<li>They believe that the <strong><u>current economic slowdown is due to the problem of insufficient demand</u></strong> which cannot be addressed just through tax cuts and instead advocate greater government spending to boost the economy.</li>
<li>Others, however, argue that la<strong><u>cklustre demand faced by sectors like automobiles is merely a symptom of supply-side shocks</u></strong> such as the GST that have affected various businesses and caused job losses.</li>
<li>If so, tax cuts and other supply-side reforms can indeed help the economy recover from its slump.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: Public Estimates Committee</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Committee on Estimates constituted for the first time in 1950, is a Parliamentary Committee consisting of 30 members, elected every year by the Lok Sabha from amongst its Members.</li>
<li>The Chairperson of the Committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members.</li>
<li>A Minister cannot be elected as a member of the Committee and if a member after selection to the Committee is appointed a Minister, the member ceases to be a Member of the Committee from the date of such appointment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Term of Office</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The term of office of the Committee is one year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The functions of the Estimates Committee are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>to report what economies, improvements in organisation, efficiency or administrative reform, consistent with the policy underlying the estimates may be effected;</li>
<li>to suggest alternative policies in order to bring about efficiency and economy in administration;</li>
<li>to examine whether the money is well laid out within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates; and</li>
<li>to suggest the form in which the estimates shall be presented to Parliament.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Labour force participation rate (LFPR)</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Women's partificaption in workforce</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-622108" height="183" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wlfpr-300x183.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wlfpr-300x183.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wlfpr.jpg 719w" width="300"/></p>
<p>Fewer than one in five Indian women are in the labour force. Four out of five are neither working nor looking for work.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>India has one of the world’s lowest female labour force participation rates (LFPR).</li>
<li>This means the productive potential of half of the population goes unutilized.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why women’s LFPR is so low in India?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are many reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A lack of demand for women workers;</li>
<li>Poor working conditions including low wages,</li>
<li>Safety concerns and exploitation;</li>
<li>Girls studying longer; migration;</li>
<li>Nuclearization of families where there are fewer women to share domestic responsibilities; and</li>
<li>Middle-income effect is where women stop working because the household has enough income.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The root of much of this is deep-set patriarchy and neglect for women’s claim to their equal place in a man’s world.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why enhancing women’s LFPR is critical?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Research and experience highlight that when women have money, they spend it on the well-being of their families.</li>
<li>From Brazil’s Bolsa Familia to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package for women with Jan Dhan accounts, policymakers have tried to reap the benefits of putting money in women’s hands.</li>
<li>One way to do this is to ensure that more women have jobs, higher wages, and equal pay.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is needed to improve women’s employment?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Persistent effort must be directed toward community sensitization to root out patriarchal social norms.</li>
<li>In addition to enforcing existing regulations like minimum wages, there must be supportive ancillary policies including childcare; secure transport; lighting; safety at work; and quotas in hiring, corporate boards, and politics  to  foster  more  women  in  leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What obstacles do we confront?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Correcting asymmetries of power is hard, especially when it entails changing convention.</li>
<li>Men who are blind to their privilege, or will be forced to share their privileges, will resist change.</li>
<li>Engendered discrimination results in a lack of labour market demand for women workers.</li>
<li>This is visible in policies such as honorariums instead of wages for Anganwadi and Asha workers.</li>
<li>It is also evident from over-reliance on home-based work for women, on and offline, instead of doing the hard work to ensure equal opportunity, outcomes, and real choice.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What happens if we don’t act?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A concerted effort to advance gender equity must be a central priority over the next 25 years.</li>
<li>Evidence shows that economic disempowerment of women can result in losses of 10% of GDP in industrialized economies and over 30% in South Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa.</li>
<li>India’s GDP could grow by nearly ₹3 trillion if women were brought into the labour market and given access to formal, ‘decent’ work opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>If we improve women’s labour force participation, not only do we harness the massive productive potential of half of the population, but their earnings will yield enormous dividends for the future of the country and economy.</li>
