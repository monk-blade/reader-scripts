<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Preventive fugitive offences</p></div></div><p>The Finance Ministry has released the Rules for Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment Rules), 2022 subsuming extant regulations for Overseas Investments and Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property outside India Regulations, 2015.</p>
<h4>What are the news Overseas Investment Rules?</h4>
<ul>
<li>With an eye on wilful defaulters, the new rules stipulate that:</li>
<li>Any Indian resident will have to seek an no objection certificate before making any overseas financial commitment:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Who has an account appearing as a non-performing asset</li>
<li>Or is classified as a wilful defaulter by any bank</li>
<li>Or is under investigation by a financial service regulator or by investigative agencies in India</li>
</ol>
<h4>What are the tweaks in overseas investment norms?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any resident in India acquiring equity capital in a foreign entity or overseas direct investment (ODI), will have to submit an Annual Performance Report (APR) for each foreign entity, every year by December 31.</li>
<li>No such reporting shall be required where a person resident in India is holding less than 10% of the equity capital without control in the foreign entity.</li>
<li>There is no other financial commitment other than equity capital or a foreign entity is under liquidation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ceiling on investment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any resident individual can make ODI by way of investment in equity capital or overseas portfolio investment (OPI) subject to the overall ceiling under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank.</li>
<li>Currently, the LRS permits $2,50,000 outward investment by an individual in a year.</li>
<li>These norms make it easier for domestic corporates to invest abroad.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the prohibitions?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any Indian resident, who has been classified as a wilful defaulter or is under investigation by the CBI, the ED or the Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO), will have to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC).</li>
<li>NOC can be obtained from his or her bank, regulatory body or investigative agency before making any overseas “financial commitment” or disinvestment of overseas assets.</li>
<li>The rules also provide that if lenders, the concerned regulatory body or investigative agency fail to furnish the NOC within 60 days of receiving an application, it may be presumed that they have no objection to the proposed transaction.</li>
<li>Additionally, the new rules also prohibit Indian residents from making investments into foreign entities that are engaged in real estate activity, gambling in any form, and dealing with financial products linked to the Indian rupee without the specific approval of the RBI.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>JCPOA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>US sanctions on Iran, Nuclear deal</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-625683" height="284" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iranus-300x167.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iranus-300x167.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iranus-768x429.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iranus.jpg 824w" width="510"/></p>
<p>Iran has dropped some of its main demands on resurrecting a deal to rein in Tehran’s nuclear programme, including its insistence that international inspectors close some probes of its program, bringing the possibility of an Iran–US agreement closer.</p>
<p><strong>Which agreement is this article referring to?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an alternative name of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).</li>
</ul>
<h4>What demands of Iran are we talking about?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Iran had already largely relented on its demand that the US lift its designation of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps as a <strong><u>foreign terrorist organization (FTO) entity</u></strong>.</li>
<li>This designation was a <strong><u>more of symbolic move</u></strong> and <strong><u>insulting to Iranian authorities</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Iran also wanted a guarantee that the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/international-atomic-energy-agency-iaea/">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</a> would close investigations involving unexplained traces of uranium.</li>
<li>Iran wants guarantees that the IAEA would close all of them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is JCPOA?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the JCPOA is a landmark accord reached between Iran and several world powers, including the United States, in July 2015.</li>
<li>Under its terms, Iran agreed to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to more extensive international inspections in exchange for billions of dollars’ worth of sanctions relief.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Expected outcomes of the deal</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curb on the nuclear program:</strong> Proponents of the deal said that it would help prevent a revival of Iran’s nuclear weapons program.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing regional engagement:</strong> It would thereby reduce the prospects for conflict between Iran and its regional rivals, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background of the JCPOA</h4>
<ul>
<li>Iran had previously agreed to forgo the development of nuclear weapons as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which has been in force since 1970.</li>
<li>However, after the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, Iranian leaders secretly pursued this technology.</li>
<li>In 2007, U.S. intelligence analysts concluded that Iran halted its work on nuclear weapons in 2003 but continued to acquire nuclear technology and expertise.</li>
<li>Prior to the JCPOA, the P5+1 had been negotiating with Iran for years, offering its government various incentives to halt uranium enrichment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with the deal</h4>
<p><strong>(1) US withdrawal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The deal has been in jeopardy since President Donald Trump withdrew the US from it in 2018.</li>
<li>In retaliation for the US, Iran resumed some of its nuclear activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Iran’s insistence over sanctions removal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, President Joe Biden said the US will return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance, though Iran’s leaders have insisted that Washington lift sanctions first.</li>
<li>Iran now has indicated that he will take a harder line than his predecessor in nuclear negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who are the participants?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The JCPOA, which went into effect in January 2016, imposes restrictions on Iran’s civilian nuclear enrichment program.</li>
<li>At the heart of negotiations with Iran were the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Germany—collectively known as the P5+1.</li>
<li>The European Union also took part. Israel explicitly opposed the agreement, calling it too lenient.</li>
<li>Some Middle Eastern powers, such as Saudi Arabia, said they should have been consulted or included in the talks because they would be most affected by a nuclear-armed Iran.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What did Iran agree to?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nuclear restrictions:</strong> Iran agreed not to produce either the highly enriched uranium or the plutonium that could be used in a nuclear weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and verification:</strong>  Iran agreed to eventually implement a protocol that would allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What did the other signatories agree to?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sanctions relief:</strong> The EU, United Nations, and United States all committed to lifting their nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. However, many other U.S. sanctions on Iran, some dating back to the 1979 hostage crisis, remained in effect.</li>
<li><strong>Weapons embargo:</strong> The parties agreed to lift an existing UN ban on Iran’s transfer of conventional weapons and ballistic missiles after five years if the IAEA certifies that Iran is only engaged in civilian nuclear activity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How has the deal affected Iran’s economy?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the JCPOA, Iran’s economy suffered <strong><u>years of recession, currency depreciation, and inflation, largely because of sanctions on its energy sector</u></strong>.</li>
<li>With the sanctions lifted, inflation slowed, exchange rates stabilized, and exports—especially of oil, agricultural goods, and luxury items­—skyrocketed as Iran regained trading partners, particularly in the EU.</li>
<li>After the JCPOA took effect, Iran began exporting more than 2.1 million barrels per day (approaching pre-2012 levels, when the oil sanctions were originally put in place).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Try this question from CSP 2020:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Q.In India, why are some nuclear reactors kept under “IAEA Safeguards” while others are not?</strong></p>
<p>(a) Some use Uranium and others use thorium.</p>
<p>(b) Some use imported uranium and others use domestic supplies.</p>
<p>(c) Some are operated by foreign enterprises and others are operated by domestic enterprises.</p>
<p>(d) Some are State- owned and others are privately-owned.</p>
<p> </p>
Post your answers here.</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</h4>
<ul>
<li>IAEA is an international organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons.</li>
<li>As the preeminent nuclear watchdog under the UN, the IAEA is entrusted with the task of upholding the principles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970.</li>
<li>It was established as an autonomous organization on July 29, 1957, at the height of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</li>
<li>Though established independently of the UN through its own international treaty, the agency reports to both the UN General Assembly and the UNSC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are its safeguards?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Safeguards are activities by which the IAEA can verify that a State is living up to its international commitments not to use nuclear programs for nuclear weapons purposes.</li>
<li>Safeguards are based on assessments of the correctness and completeness of a State’s declared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities.</li>
<li>Verification measures include on-site inspections, visits, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, two sets of measures are carried out in accordance with the type of safeguards agreements in force with a State.</p>
<ol>
<li>One set relates to verifying State reports of declared nuclear material and activities.</li>
<li>Another set enables the IAEA not only to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material but also to provide assurances as to the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in a State.</li>
</ol>

<p>After months of what appeared to be a go-slow, the Union government has pushed up its interest in using Iran’s Chabahar port to connect to Afghanistan and Central Asia for trade, with the visit of the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping &amp; Waterways to the port.</p>
<h4>Chabahar Port</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2016, India signed a deal with Iran entailing $8 billion investment in Chabahar port and industries in Chabahar Special Economic Zone.</li>
<li>The port is being developed as a transit route to Afghanistan and Central Asia.</li>
<li>India has already built a 240-km road connecting Afghanistan with Iran.</li>
<li>All this were expected to bring cargo to Bandar Abbas port and Chabahar port, and free Kabul from its dependence on Pakistan to reach the outer world.</li>
<li>Completion of this project would give India access to Afghanistan and beyond to Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Europe via 7,200-km-long multi-modal North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is Chabahar back in the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The visit is a chance to strengthen ties and the maritime relationship between the two countries.</li>
<li>Due to pandemic, there were less number of visits from India to Iran and vice-versa and the pace of the project is also allegedly slower.</li>
<li>This visit will also highlight the importance of Chabahar as a gateway for Indian trade with Europe, Russia and CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] countries.</li>
<li>India is keen in developing the Shahid Beheshti port as a “a transit hub” and link it to the International North South Trade Corridor (INSTC), that also connects to Russia and Europe.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is India’s strategic vision for Chabahar?</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-625684" height="653" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chabahar-188x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chabahar-188x300.jpg 188w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chabahar-565x900.jpg 565w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/chabahar.jpg 632w" width="409"/></p>
<ul>
<li>When the first agreement for Chabahar was signed by then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2003, the plan had a three-fold objective:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To build India’s first offshore port and to project Indian infrastructure prowess in the Gulf</li>
<li>To circumvent trade through Pakistan, given the tense ties with India’s neighbour and build a long term, sustainable sea trade route and</li>
<li>To find an alternative land route to Afghanistan, which India had rebuilt ties with after the defeat of the Taliban in 2001</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Subsequently, PM Manmohan Singh’s government constructed the Zaranj -Delaram Highway in Afghanistan’s South.</li>
<li>It would help connect the trade route from the border of Iran to the main trade routes to Herat and Kabul, handing it over to the Karzai government in 2009.</li>
<li>In 2016, PM Modi travelled to Tehran and signed the agreement to develop Chabahar port, as well as the trilateral agreement for trade through Chabahar with Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Commencement of operations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the India Ports Global Chabahar Free Zone (IPGCFZ) authority took over the operations of the port in 2018, it has handled 215 vessels, 16,000 TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units) and four million tons of bulk and general cargo.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is it gaining importance?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the last few years, a fourth strategic objective for the Chabahar route has appeared, with <strong><u>China’s Belt and Road Initiative making inroads</u></strong> in the region.</li>
<li>The government hopes to provide Central Asia with an alternate route to the <strong><u>China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)</u></strong> through Iran for future trade.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is the Chabahar dream taking so long to realise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s quest for Chabahar has hit <strong><u>geopolitical road-block</u></strong> after road-block; the biggest issue has been over Iran’s relationship with western countries, especially the United States.</li>
<li>In years when <strong><u>western sanctions</u></strong> against Iran increased, the Chabahar project has been put on the back-burner.</li>
<li>However, the nuclear talks resulted in the <strong><u>Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)</u></strong> in 2015 came into being, the Chabahar port has been easier to work on.</li>
<li>In 2018, the <strong><u>Trump administration</u></strong> put paid to India’s plans by <strong><u>walking out of the JCPOA</u></strong> and slapping <strong><u>new sanctions</u></strong> on dealing with Iran.</li>
<li>This led to the Modi government <strong><u>“zeroing out” all its oil imports from Iran</u></strong>, earlier a major supplier to India, causing a strain in ties.</li>
<li>India also <strong><u>snapped ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover</u></strong> in August 2021, which put an end to the humanitarian aid of wheat and pulses that was being sent to Kabul via Chabahar.</li>
<li>When India restarted wheat aid this year, it <strong><u>negotiated with Pakistan</u></strong> to use the <strong><u>land route to Afghanistan instead. </u></strong></li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Benami Properties</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The Supreme Court has declared as “unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary” the amendments introduced to the Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988  in 2016, which apply retrospectively and can send a person to prison for three years even as it empowers the Centre to confiscate “any property” subject to a benami transaction.</p>
<h4>What is Benami Property?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Benami in Hindi means without name. So, a property bought by an individual not under his or her name is benami property.</li>
<li>It can include property held in the name of spouse or child for which the <strong><u>amount is paid out of known sources of income. </u></strong></li>
<li>A joint property with brother, sister or other relatives for which the amount is paid out of known sources of income also falls under benami property.</li>
<li>The transaction involved in the same is called benami transaction.</li>
<li>The benami transactions include buying assets of any kind — movable, immovable, tangible, intangible, any right or interest, or legal documents.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why do people indulge in such transactions?</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a usual practice, to evade taxation, people invest their black money in buying benami property.</li>
<li>The real owner of these properties are hard to trace due to fake names and identities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the Benami Law?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first act against benami properties was passed in 1988 as the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988.</li>
<li>To block all <strong><u>loopholes</u></strong>, the government in July 2016 decided to amend the original act.</li>
<li>So after further amendment, Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 came into force on November 1, 2016.</li>
<li>The PBPT Act defines benami transactions, prohibits them and further provides that violation of the PBPT Act is punishable with imprisonment and fine.</li>
<li>The PBPT Act <strong><u>prohibits recovery of the property</u></strong> held benami from benamidar by the real owner.</li>
<li>Such, <strong><u>properties are liable for confiscation</u></strong> by the Government without payment of compensation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What amendment is this article talking about?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 2016 law amended the original Benami Act of 1988, expanding it to 72 Sections from a mere nine.</li>
<li>Sections 3(2) and 5 were introduced through the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016.</li>
<li>A Bench, led by CJI N.V. Ramana, declared Sections 3(2) and 5 introduced through this amendment as unconstitutional.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which sections did the Supreme Court declare unconstitutional?</h4>
<h4>(b) Section 3(2)</h4>
<ul>
<li>A/c to this, a <strong><u>person can be sent behind bars for a benami transaction entered into 28 years before the Section even came into existence</u></strong>.</li>
<li>CJI Ramana held that the <strong><u>provision violated Article 20(1) of the Constitution</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Article 20(1) mandates that <strong><u>no person should be convicted of an offence, which was not in force “at the time of the commission </u></strong>of the act charged as an offence”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(b) Section 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>It said that “any <strong><u>benami property shall be liable to be confiscated</u></strong> by the Central Government”.</li>
<li>The court held that this confiscation provision<strong><u> cannot be applied retrospectively</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The CJI dismissed the government’s version that forfeiture, acquisition and confiscation of property under the 2016 Act was <strong><u>not in the nature of prosecution</u></strong> and cannot be restricted under Article 20.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What else did the apex court observe?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The court observed that the 2016 Act condemned not only transactions that were traditionally denominated as benami but also a “new class of fictitious and sham transactions”.</li>
<li>The court said the intention of Parliament was to condemn property acquired from ill-gotten wealth.</li>
<li>These proceedings cannot be equated as enforcing civil obligations, the CJI noted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why curb benami transactions?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflationary implications:</strong> Rather than hoarding the black money in cash, the tax evader invest their accumulated illegal money in buying benami properties.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of economic activity:</strong> The whole process affects the revenue generation of government hampering growth and development of the state.</li>
<li><strong>Tax evasion:</strong> Since the percentage of tax payer in the country is a dismal low, the government fails to successfully implement its policies and schemes due to lack of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Money laundering:</strong> Benami transactions also serves the illicit purpose of money laundering.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>A tough law against benami properties is the need of the hour to check corruption.</li>
<li>However, due process of law needs to be followed in true letter and spirit.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>ONDC</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Online Dispute Resolution</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>Despite the rapid advancement of digital platforms on the one hand and the pervasiveness of the Internet-enabled phone on the other, small enterprises such as local <i>kirana </i>stores have not gained from this. Online purchases from “near and now” inventory from the local store remain in a digital vacuum.</p>
<h4>Online revolution in country</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased smartphone use</strong>: The rise in smartphone use fuelled by affordable data plans has catalysed an online revolution in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic accelerated digital inclusion:</strong> The novel coronavirus pandemic has further accelerated the process of digital inclusion.</li>
<li>It is now not only routine to transact online it is also common to learn online, have medical consultations online, and even resolve disputes online.</li>
<li><strong>Increased scope for innovation in digital space:</strong> These realisations have given India the opportunity to disrupt the status quo with its innovative abilities.</li>
<li>Systems such as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Aadhaar, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission have reengineered markets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why mall and medium sided businesses have not benefited from digital revolution?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Despite the rapid advancement of digital platforms small enterprises such as local kirana stores have not gained from this.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of infrastructure:</strong> This is because, to sell on numerous platforms, sellers must <strong>maintain a separate infrastructure,</strong> which only adds costs and limits participation.</li>
<li><strong>Distinct terms and conditions of platforms:</strong> The distinct terms and conditions of each platform further limit the sellers’ flexibility.</li>
<li>Consequently, small and medium-sized businesses have lost their freedom to choose and participate in the country’s e-commerce system at their will and on their terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward: Open Network for Digital Commerce</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) of the Government of India established the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)<strong> to level the playing field</strong> by developing open e-commerce and enabling access to small businesses and dealers.</li>
<li>The ONDC began its pilot in five cities in April 2022, i.e., New Delhi, Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Bhopal and Shillong.</li>
<li>Currently, the pilot has expanded to 18 cities, and there are immediate plans to add more cities.</li>
<li>The ONDC network makes it possible for products and services from all participating e-commerce platforms to be displayed in search results across all network apps.</li>
<li>For instance, a consumer shopping for a product on an e-commerce app named “X” would also receive results from e-commerce app named “Y”, if both X and Y integrated their platforms with the ONDC.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dispute resolution through ODR</h4>
<ul>
<li>Disputes will be the obvious by-product of this e-commerce revolution.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is imperative to support this initiative with a modern-day, cost-effective, timely and high-speed dispute resolution system.</li>
<li><strong>Online Dispute Resolution, or ODR</strong> as it is popularly called, has the propensity to work alongside the incumbent setup and deliver quick, affordable and enforceable outcomes.</li>
<li>The ODR is not restricted to the use of legal mechanisms such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration in an online environment but can be tailormade for the specific use case keeping the participants in mind.</li>
<li>ODR commonly involves case management systems, integration of communication technologies such as email, SMS, WhatsApp, Interactive Voice Response, audio/video conferencing.</li>
<li>With appropriate data sets in place, it can also involve advanced automation, the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable resolutions at the same time as it would take to initiate a transaction over the network.</li>
<li>Many e-commerce companies have turned to the ODR with the realisation that in order to maximise transactions it is important to ensure a positive dispute resolution experience.</li>
<li>Adoption in India: The ODR is no more a distant dream for India as well.</li>
<li>The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated platforms in the UPI ecosystem <strong>to adopt the ODR for complaints and grievances connected to failed transactions</strong>.</li>
<li> Ingram, SEBI SCORES (or the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI COm plaints REdress System), RBI CMS (or the Reserve Bank of India Complaint Management System), MahaRERA (or the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority), MSME Samadhaan (or the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Delayed Payment Monitoring System), and RTIOnline (or the Right to Information Online) are other examples of ODR systems that are widely used in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigating litigation risks</strong>: The ODR will help mitigate litigation risk and provide valuable insights into problems faced by consumers.</li>
<li>Consumers are provided with another choice for effective redress of their grievances, thereby building trust, confidence and brand loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advantages of ONDC</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wider choice for consumers:</strong> The ONDC achieves the dual objective of wider choice for consumers on the one hand and access to a wider consumer base for sellers on the other.</li>
<li>With India’s e-commerce industry set to reach $200 billion by 2027, this shift from a platform-centric paradigm to democratisation of the nation’s online market will catalyse the <strong>inclusion of millions of small business owners and kirana businesses.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>A dispute resolution framework that includes a customised ODR process can play a role in the network achieving its steep five-year target of adding $48 billion in gross merchandise value to India’s e-commerce market, a network of 90 crore buyers and 12 crore sellers with the least hiccups.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>WTO waiver</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Public Stockholding of Food issue at WTO</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>The WTO ministerial meeting in June at Geneva did precious little to address the issue of public stockholding of food.</p>
<h4>Public stockholding issue at WTO</h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s PSH policy is based on<strong> procuring food from farmers at an administered price</strong> (minimum support price or MSP), which is generally higher than the market price.</li>
<li><strong>PSH’s’ twin objectives:</strong> The PSH policy serves the twin objectives of offering remunerative prices to farmers and providing subsidised food to the underprivileged.</li>
<li><strong>Trade distortion subsidy:</strong> Under WTO law, such price support-based procurement from farmers is counted as a trade-distorting subsidy, and if given beyond the permissible limit, breaches WTO law.</li>
<li>India in the World Trade Organization (WTO) — and rightly so — has been to find a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding (PSH) of food to protect India’s food security (PSH policy).</li>
<li><strong>Peace clause:</strong> Currently, India has temporary relief due to a<strong> ‘peace clause’</strong> which bars countries from bringing legal challenges against price support-based procurement for food security purposes.</li>
<li>The WTO ministerial meeting in June at Geneva did precious little to address this issue.</li>
<li> India’s concerns about the PSH issue have been taken on board.</li>
</ul>
<h4>India’s concerns</h4>
<ul>
<li>For India, the real issue is not about maintaining adequate food stocks, which WTO rules do not prohibit, provided food is stocked by employing non-trade distorting instruments such as providing income support to farmers (cash transfers independent of crop production).</li>
<li><strong>Use of MSP:</strong> India’s concern is that it should have the policy space to hold public food stocks using the MSP, which is a price support instrument.</li>
<li>However, there is no mention of price support in the Geneva declaration.</li>
<li>India’s demand for a permanent solution to the PSH policy has acquired a new dimension.</li>
<li>India insists that it should also be <strong>allowed to export food</strong>, most notably wheat, from the pool of the foodgrain procured under the MSP.</li>
<li>However, WTO law proscribes countries from <strong>exporting foodgrain procured at subsidised prices.</strong></li>
<li>Paragraph 4 of the 2013 WTO decision on PSH for food security purposes, clearly states that countries procuring food for food-security purposes shall ensure that such procured food does not “distort trade or adversely affect the food security of other Members”.</li>
<li>The same spirit is reflected in paragraph 10 of the Geneva ministerial food security declaration, which states that countries may release surplus food stocks in the international market in accordance with WTO law.</li>
<li> However, it is very unlikely that such a request will be acceded to.</li>
<li>As per Article IX.3 of the WTO Agreement, waivers can be adopted only in “<strong>exceptional circumstances</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>Developed countries have historically opposed India’s PSH programme as they apprehend that India might divert some of its public stock to the international market, thus depressing global prices.</li>
<li>India actively pushing for exporting food from its official granaries gives fresh ammunition to the PSH solution opponents.</li>
<li>Thus,<strong> India should revisit its stand</strong> on asking for a waiver for wheat exports from its public stockholding, which, in any case, was not a part of India’s PSH policy.</li>
<li>Spending scarce negotiating capital on this issue might dilute India’s core agenda of pushing for a permanent solution for its PSH programme to attain the goal of food security and providing remunerative prices to the farmers.</li>
<li>Negotiations at the WTO require crystal clarity of the core objectives that should be relentlessly pursued.</li>
<li>Adding newer objectives and shifting goalposts might result in falling between two stools.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Instead of asking for the waiver to export wheat from public stockholding, the laudable objective of helping countries facing food crises can be accomplished by strengthening India’s commitment to the United Nations World Food Programme.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Standing Deposit Facility rate</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Dealing with economically challenging period</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>In the recent MPC meeting, the policy rate hike was widely expected, more anticipated were the MPC and the RBI Governor’s forward guidance on the trajectory of policy — on both monetary policy and liquidity instruments. So, how do we see monetary policy evolve over the rest of the year and beyond?</p>
<h4>Tightening of monetary policy</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repo rate at 5.4 per cent:</strong> In its latest meeting, the members of the monetary policy committee voted unanimously to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to<strong> 5.4 per cent.</strong></li>
<li>The repo rate was 5.15 per cent in February 2020.</li>
<li>So, in effect, the RBI’s policy has not only been normalised, but has actually tightened <strong>compared to the pre-pandemic level.</strong></li>
<li> Even the lower bound of the rate corridor, the <strong>Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate,</strong> at 5.25 per cent is now above the pre-pandemic repo rate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Forward guidance on stance</h4>
<ul>
<li>The MPS indicated the retaining the policy stance rather than shifting to “neutral”.</li>
<li>This <strong>retention of stance</strong> might be interpreted as being a bit more hawkish than “neutral”, which implies that rates might be both increased or cut, depending on economic conditions.</li>
<li>Now that policy is largely normalised, the <strong>pace of tightening</strong> is likely to moderate.</li>
<li>The urgency of aggressive rate hikes and tightening of liquidity has somewhat moderated, although risks remain.</li>
<li>RBI’s research suggests that the “real natural rate” — the rate at which policy is neither loose nor tight – is 0.8-1 per cent.</li>
<li>This operative interest rate is usually the<strong> three-month T-bill rate,</strong> which in “normal” times averages 10-15 basis points above the repo rate.</li>
<li>Considering that monetary policy is calibrated over a one-year horizon and using the RBI’s inflation forecast of 5 per cent for the first quarter of 2023-24, <strong>the “natural” repo rate will be around 5.85 per cent.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Inflation and growth conditions</h4>
<ul>
<li>The RBI’s growth projection for 2022-23 has been retained at 7.2 per cent, with growth frontloaded in the first half.</li>
<li>CPI inflation is still forecast to average 6.7 per cent.</li>
<li>Inflationary pressures are likely to wane in the second half of 2022-23, particularly if the recent drop in industrial metals prices persists over the next few months.</li>
<li>A more or less normal monsoon might help in keeping food prices stable. However, risks remain.</li>
<li><strong>Robust growth prospects</strong>: Demand for consumption goods seems to be resilient, enabling some further pass-through of input costs.</li>
<li>Combine this with tight labour markets and rising wage costs in some tech-oriented sectors.</li>
<li>High frequency indicators of economic activity have recovered after some weakness in June.</li>
<li>In addition to resilient demand, there is evidence of a closing of the “output gap”.</li>
<li><strong>Global growth:</strong> Global growth and trade are forecast to significantly slow down in 2022 and 2023, largely due<strong> to aggressive tightening by G-10 central banks</strong> and a slowdown in China.</li>
<li>The IMF predicts global trade volume (both merchandise and services) to slow to 4.1 per cent and 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2023, down from 10.1 per cent in 2021.</li>
<li>With world growth and trade flows moderating, along with a drop in commodities prices,<strong> India’s export growth is likely to be lower than last year.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>External financial condition</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current account deficit remains a concern.</li>
<li>India’s<strong> external balance sheet</strong> remains quite robust, as is evident from various balance of payments and debt metrics, and reportedly <strong>low unhedged foreign currency borrowings.</strong></li>
<li>Continued <strong>tightening by global central banks</strong>, particularly the US Federal Reserve over the rest of 2022, will keep India’s external financial conditions tight and likely <strong>limit portfolio capital flows. </strong></li>
<li>However, there are some signs emanating from these central banks that the hitherto front-loaded tightening might moderate going forward.</li>
<li>This will <strong>take some pressure off the rupee,</strong> though, exchange rate volatility management will remain a part of the overall monetary policy management framework.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenge of surplus liquidity</h4>
<ul>
<li>During the earlier phase of policy normalisation and the recent tightening, liquidity management has played an important role in influencing short-term money market interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>The current latent surplus liquidity</strong> — the existing funds with banks and the Union government’s unspent revenues parked with RBI — is over Rs 5 lakh crore.</li>
<li>While the extent of liquidity surplus during the Covid months has come down, these levels are still much higher than RBI estimates of non-inflationary levels of surplus, <strong>which is around Rs 1.8-2.4 lakh crore. </strong></li>
<li>This will gradually fall with cash withdrawals and some potential RBI dollar sales in the coming months.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The central bank, in coordination with the government, has ensured an orderly evolution of economic conditions during a very complex and challenging environment. The exit process now will also need the same adroit use of policy instruments.</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: Standing Deposit Facility rate</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in April 2022 introduced the <strong>Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)</strong>, an additional tool for absorbing liquidity, at an interest rate of 3.75 per cent.</li>
<li>The main purpose of SDF is to reduce the excess liquidity  in the system, and control inflation.</li>
<li>In 2018, the amended Section 17 of the RBI Act empowered the Reserve Bank to introduce the SDF –<strong> an additional tool for absorbing liquidity without any collateral. </strong></li>
<li>By removing the binding collateral constraint on the RBI, the SDF strengthens the operating framework of monetary policy.</li>
<li>The SDF is also a financial stability tool in addition to its role in liquidity management.</li>
<li>The SDF replaced the fixed rate reverse repo (FRRR) as the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor.</li>
<li>The SDF rate will be 25 bps below the policy rate (Repo rate), and it will be applicable to overnight deposits at this stage.</li>
<li>It would, however, retain the flexibility to absorb liquidity of longer tenors as and when the need arises, with appropriate pricing.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Trade and settlement of payments in rupee</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>A number of countries, including India, are now considering the use of other currencies to avoid the U.S. dollar and its hegemonic role in settling international transactions.</p>
<h4>Currency hierarchy</h4>
<ul>
<li>For India, currency hierarchy goes back to colonial times when the Indian rupee was virtually <strong>linked to the British pound</strong> rather than to gold which it earned through exports.</li>
<li>In the post-War period, the neo-colonial currency hierarchy has been clubbed with the continued use, primarily of the U.S. dollar, for the majority of international transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rupee settlement of trade</h4>
<ul>
<li>In recent times, India has been taking an active interest in having the rupee used for trade and the settlement of payments with other countries, which include Russia, now facing sanctions.</li>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India has recently taken a proactive stand to have rupee settlement of trade (circular dated July 11, 2022).</li>
<li>While options for invoicing in rupees were already legal in terms of Regulation 7(1) of the <strong>Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016,</strong> the current circular aims to operationalise the special<strong> Vostro accounts with Russian banks in India</strong>, in a bid to promote trade and also gain a better status for the rupee as an international currency.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Opportunities for India</h4>
<ul>
<li>The advantages India is currently seeking in these arrangements include avoidance of transactions in the highly priced dollar which has an exchange value of ₹80, impacting the Indian economy with inflation, capital flight and the <strong>drop in foreign exchange reserves</strong> by $70 billion since September 2021.</li>
<li> Buying oil with a depreciated ruble, and at discounts, is not only cost-saving but also saves transport time with the use of multi-modal routes using land, sea and air routes.</li>
<li>In addition, India is looking forward to trade expansion in sanctions-affected Russia.</li>
<li>With India having a trade deficit with Russia, which has been around $<strong>3.52 billion</strong> on average over the last two financial years, India’s opportunities include the possible use, by Russia, of the surpluses in the Vostro rupee account in Russian banks for additional purchases from India.</li>
<li><strong>Past attempts</strong>: Attempts to use the rupee for invoicing and trading is, however, not new to India.</li>
<li>A comprehensive bilateral trade and payments agreement was signed by India in 1953 with the Soviet bloc countries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are quite a few problems that may prevail in implementing the desired rupee payments and avoiding dollar transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Willingness of banks and private parties:</strong> Apart from issues that concern an agreed<strong> exchange rate</strong> between the rupee and the ruble (R-R), two volatile currencies, there is also the question of the willingness of private parties (companies, banks) to accept the rupee for trade and settlements.</li>
<li> If Russia opens its door for exports from India, the ‘R-R’ route may prove attractive for Indian exporters.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns of the US:</strong> There are official concerns for reactions, particularly from the U.S., to deals, especially for purchase of the S-400 defence equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction of the Europe:</strong> Moreover, the deals between India and Russia, especially on oil, can be considered by the West as ‘indirect back door support’ — as India is importing Russian crude<strong> at 30% discount,</strong> processing at refineries in Gujarat which include Reliance, and then exporting those to the West.</li>
<li><strong>Trade deficit:</strong> There were attempts even before the novel coronavirus pandemic to initiate a clearing account on the BRICS platform.</li>
<li>The quantitative implications indicate a skewed pattern of transactions — with China having most of the trade surplus.</li>
<li>It is a pattern similar to what is happening in India-Russia trade at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The India-Soviet agreements of the past may provide a clue on how the current ‘R-R’ trade and the problems can be managed by initiating a push for Indian exports to Russia and, of course, avoiding all deals in dollars — benefiting both trade partners and countering, globally, the on-going currency hierarchy.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>European Union’s Digital Services Act</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 2- Need for personal data protection act</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>In a surprise development last week, the Government withdrew the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019, thereby abruptly halting the country’s quest for a national data protection law that had been in the works for over five years.</p>
<h4>Reasons for withdrawal of the Bill</h4>
<ul>
<li>The short circular issued by the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology states that considering the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) — it had proposed 81 amendments and made 12 recommendations — <strong>“a comprehensive legal framework is being worked on”. </strong></li>
<li>There is no elaboration on what such a “comprehensive legal framework” entails.</li>
<li><strong>Possible plan of action: </strong>The Government could enact a fresh privacy legislation or <strong>a comprehensive data protection law</strong> (covering both personal and non-personal data).</li>
<li><strong>Subsuming data protection in IT Act:</strong> Alternatively, it could subsume data protection under its ongoing attempts at revising the existing Information Technology Act, 2000.</li>
<li><strong>Digital markets law:</strong> It could also enact a digital markets law, along the lines of the<strong> European Union’s Digital Services Act</strong>, focusing on competition and innovation in the digital space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background of the introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the Supreme Court of India affirmed the right to privacy in  <strong>K.S. Puttaswamy judgment in 2017</strong>, the nine-judge Bench of the Court referred to the Government’s Office Memorandum constituting the<strong> B.N. Srikrishna Committee</strong> to suggest a draft Data Protection Bill.</li>
<li>The committee released its draft Personal Data Protection Bill in 2018, which was the first public articulation of a data protection law in India.</li>
<li>When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, the majority emphasised that it believed that “there is a need for a proper legislative mechanism for data protection”.</li>
<li>In December 2019, the Government introduced the PDP Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha as a comprehensive personal data protection regime.</li>
<li>The Bill was referred to the JPC for its recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What were the issues with the Bill?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power to exemption with state:</strong> The Bill’s expansive exemptions <strong>allowed the state to exempt the entire application of the law</strong> simply as if it was “expedient” to do so in the interest of national security or public order.</li>
<li><strong>Powers without accountability:</strong> The PDP Bill, 2019 as well as the JPC’s version established a strong regulator (the Data Protection Authority) with a lot of power, but very little independence or accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Data localisation:</strong> The Bill imposed a s<strong>trong data localisation mandate</strong>, requiring companies to store all sensitive personal data and critical personal data (which was not defined) in India.</li>
<li><strong>Subsuming the personal and non-personal data:</strong> The JPC recommended subsuming the regulation of personal data and non-personal data within a single legislation, even though it undermined the Puttaswamy mandate to ensure protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why we need data protection law?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing internet use:</strong> India currently has over <strong>750 million Internet users</strong>, with the number only expected to increase in the future.</li>
<li>The Government is also making a strong push for a <strong>‘Digital India’,</strong> with increased focus on digitisation of access to health, ration, banking, insurance, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>There is<strong> a greater focus on the inter-linking of data,</strong> whether through facial recognition, Aadhaar, or the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Data breaches:</strong> At the same time, India has among the highest data breaches in the world.</li>
<li>Without a data protection law in place, the data of millions of Indians continues to be at risk of being exploited, sold, and misused without their consent.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of writ proceeding against corporate action:</strong> Unlike state action, corporate action or misconduct is not subject to writ proceedings in India.</li>
<li>This is because fundamental rights are, by and large, not enforceable against private non-state entities.</li>
<li>This leaves individuals with limited remedies against private actors.</li>
<li>A personal data protection legislation would remedy this lacuna by providing individuals with proper grievance redress options and creating sufficient deterrence among private actors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>It is imperative that the Government soon introduces a fresh data protection legislation, drawn after proper public consultation. Such a law should take into consideration the criticisms that have been raised by civil society as well as the private sector.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Tax buoyancy</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Tax-to-GDP ratio</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>What the data conclusively show is that the debate on the Indian economy should shift away from simplistic notions (borrowed from the West?) of the tax-GDP ratio being low in India.</p>
<h4>India’s low tax-to-GDP ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the stylised beliefs in India, and amongst some leading economic commentators both in India and abroad, is that our tax/GDP ratio is lower than what it “should” be.</li>
<li>This low tax-to-GDP ratio is blamed for a<strong> lower rate of investment</strong>, a<strong> higher fiscal deficit</strong>, and lower GDP growth — and all because the tax ratio is too low.</li>
<li>There can be reasonable doubts about the presumed links.</li>
<li>There are three important fiscal variables in the economy — <strong>taxes, fiscal deficit, and debt. </strong></li>
<li>They are inter-related — lower tax revenue means higher fiscal deficit, for the same level of expenditures, and higher deficit means higher debt.</li>
<li>All three, directly or indirectly, are assumed <strong>to affect growth and/or inflation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Analysing India’s tax-to-GDP ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two common observations on tax-to-GDP for India — first, it is low at around<strong> 10-11 per cent of GDP</strong> and it has stayed at close to that level for the last 20 years.</li>
<li>In 2019, it hit a decade low of 10 per cent of GDP, the same as in 2014.</li>
<li>Second, in comparison with our peers, it is much lower.</li>
<li>Hence, logic dictates that we should strive to increase it.</li>
<li>But which country should we compare India with?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with comparing tax-to-GDP with other countries</h4>
<ul>
<li>A common observation is to look at the tax-GDP ratio in G20 countries.</li>
<li><strong>Function of average level of per capita income:</strong> This is the beginning of a set of misinterpretations committed either knowingly, or unknowingly.</li>
<li>Because simple logic dictates that tax collected is <strong>a function of the average level of per capita income.</strong></li>
<li>Per capita income in the G20 varies from around $2,100 (India) to around $65,000 (US).</li>
<li>The 10-11 per cent figure for India is the tax/GDP <strong>ratio for taxes administered at the central level.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in data collection</strong>: Taxes in India, as in many other large, especially federal, countries, are collected at both a federal and state level.</li>
<li>And many economies have local (municipal) taxes as well. The tax collected is the sum of all these taxes.</li>
<li>Until now, collecting such disaggregated data for a large set of countries was challenging.</li>
<li>However, in a recent web publication, the IMF on their World Revenue Longitudinal Data set has published such data for all countries, from 1990-2019.</li>
<li>In this pre-pandemic year, among G20 economies, India’s tax-GDP (Xtax) ratio of 16.7 per cent was higher than that of China (15.9 per cent), Mexico (14.1 per cent), Indonesia (11.0 per cent), Saudi Arabia (5.9 per cent) and Turkey (15.9 per cent).</li>
<li>A more informative indicator of whether a country is taxing too much or too little in comparison with others is to look at the <strong>tax-GDP ratio adjusted for PPP per capita income.</strong></li>
<li>Prediction via a simple regression of tax-to-GDP on log PPP per capita GDP can yield one estimate of the tax gap — the difference between actual and actual adjusted for level of income.</li>
<li>The world average tax gap is -1.3 per cent;<strong> India is +1.2 per cent for the nine years 2011-2019.</strong></li>
<li>So, India’s tax GDP ratio averages 2.5 percentage points more than an average economy.</li>
<li>For every year for which data are available 1990-2019, India has had a positive tax gap — there is little evidence that a higher tax/GDP ratio helps growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How corporate tax cut helped India</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate tax cut 2019:</strong> For years, the advocacy in India was to increase revenue from corporate tax which is one of three major components of tax revenue, the other being income and indirect taxes.</li>
<li>In September 2019, Finance Minister going well against Indian established conventional wisdom, lowered the corporate tax rate by around 10 percentage points.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding triple whammy</strong>: Opponents said that empirical evidence around the world (for example, the US) meant that <strong>if tax rates were lowered, revenues would decline, the fisc would increase, as would inequality.</strong></li>
<li>A triple whammy that is best avoided.</li>
<li>However, now, three years later, we can assess the efficacy (or not) of this bold experiment.</li>
<li>For the three months April-June 2022, corporate tax revenues, y-o-y, are up 30 per cent.</li>
<li>Using fiscal 2019-20 as a base, corporate tax revenue has increased by 66 per cent, GDP by 33 per cent —<strong> an average tax buoyancy of 2.0 over three years. </strong></li>
<li>The previous largest tax buoyancy was in 2006-7 when the world was buoyant.</li>
<li>Tentatively, the tax-GDP ratio in the fiscal year 2022-23 will <strong>average over 18 per cent in India</strong>, a level close to Japan and the US.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In India, the debate should shift to expenditures, and quality of expenditures (and perhaps to reform of the direct tax code). In this regard, suggestion that freebies be critically examined is most timely and welcome.</p>

<h4> Back2Basics: Tax buoyancy and tax elasticity</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax buoyancy:</strong> The buoyancy of a tax system <b>measures the total response of tax revenue both to changes in</b>. <b>national income and to discretionary changes in tax policies over time</b>, and it is traditionally interpreted as the percentage change in revenue associated to a one percent change in income.</li>
<li>Tax elasticity: It refers to changes in tax revenue in response to <strong>changes in tax rate. </strong></li>
<li>For example, how tax revenue changes if the government reduces corporate income tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent indicate tax elasticity.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Competition Amendment Bill 2022</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The long-awaited Bill to amend the Competition Act, 2002, was finally tabled in the Lok Sabha recently.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Indian Competition Act?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Competition Act was passed in 2002, but it came into effect only seven years later.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/pib-competition-commission-of-india/">Competition Commission</a> primarily pursues three issues of anti-competitive practices in the market: anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominance and combinations.</li>
<li>As the dynamics of the market changes rapidly due to technological advancements, AI, and the increasing importance of factors other than price, amendments became necessary to sustain and promote market competition.</li>
<li>Therefore, a review committee was established in 2019 which proposed several major amendments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022: Key features</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) Regulation of combinations based on transaction value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act prohibits any person or enterprise from entering into a combination which may cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition.</li>
<li>Combinations imply mergers, acquisitions, or amalgamation of enterprises.</li>
<li>The prohibition applies to transactions where parties involved have: (i) cumulative assets of more than Rs 1,000 crore, or (ii) cumulative turnover of more than Rs 3,000 crore, subject to certain other conditions.</li>
<li>The Bill expands the definition of combinations to include transactions with a value above Rs 2,000 crore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2)  Definition of control for classification of combination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For classification of combinations, the Act defines control as control over the affairs or management by one or more enterprises over another enterprise or group.</li>
<li>The Bill modifies the definition of control as the ability to exercise material influence over the management, affairs, or strategic commercial decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Time limit for approval of combinations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act specifies that any combination shall not come into effect until the CCI has passed an order or 210 days have passed from the day when an application for approval was filed, whichever is earlier.</li>
<li>The Bill reduces the time limit in the latter case to 150 days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Anti-competitive agreements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the Act, anti-competitive agreements include any agreement related to production, supply, storage, or control of goods or services, which can cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India.</li>
<li>Any agreement between enterprises or persons, engaged in identical or similar businesses, will have such adverse effect on competition if it meets certain criteria.</li>
<li>These include: (i) directly or indirectly determining purchase or sale prices, (ii) controlling production, supply, markets, or provision of services, or (iii) directly or indirectly leading to collusive bidding.</li>
<li>The Bill adds that enterprises or persons not engaged in identical or similar businesses shall be presumed to be part of such agreements, if they actively participate in the furtherance of such agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5) Settlement and Commitment in anti-competitive proceedings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the Act, CCI may initiate proceedings against enterprises on grounds of: (i) entering into anti-competitive agreements, or (ii) abuse of dominant position.</li>
<li>Abuse of dominant position includes: (i) discriminatory conditions in the purchase or sale of goods or services, (ii) restricting production of goods or services, or (iii) indulging in practices leading to the denial of market access.</li>
<li>The Bill permits CCI to close inquiry proceedings if the enterprise offers: (i) settlement (may involve payment), or (ii) commitments (may be structural or behavioral in nature).</li>
<li>The manner and implementation of settlement and commitment may be specified by CCI through regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(6) Relevant product market</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act defines relevant product market as products and services which are considered substitutable by the consumer.</li>
<li>The Bill widens this to include the production or supply of products and services considered substitutable by the suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(7) Decriminalization of certain offences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bill changes the nature of punishment for certain offences from imposition of fine to penalty.</li>
<li>These offences include failure to comply with orders of CCI and directions of Director General with regard to anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most notable amendment on: Merger and acquisition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any acquisition, merger or amalgamation may constitute a combination.</li>
<li>Section 5 currently says parties indulging in merger, acquisition, or amalgamation need to notify the Commission of the combination only on the basis of ‘asset’ or ‘turnover’.</li>
<li>The new Bill proposes to add a ‘deal value’ threshold.</li>
<li>It will be mandatory to notify the Competition Commission of any transaction with a deal value in excess of ₹2,000 crore and if either of the parties has ‘substantial business operations in India’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key note on gun-jumping</p>
<ul>
<li>Parties should not go ahead with a combination prior to its approval.</li>
<li>If the combining parties close a notified transaction before the approval, or have consummated a reportable transaction without bringing it to the Commission’s knowledge, it is seen as gun-jumping.</li>
<li>The penalty for gun-jumping was a total of 1% of the asset or turnover.</li>
<li>This is now proposed to be 1% of the deal value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By implementing these amendments, the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/pib-competition-commission-of-india/">Competition Commission</a> should be better equipped to handle certain aspects of the new-age market and transform its functioning to be more robust.</li>
<li>The proposed amendments are undoubtedly needed; however, these are heavily dependent on regulations that will be notified by the Commission later.</li>
<li>These regulations will influence the proposals.</li>
<li>Also, the government needs to recognize that market dynamics change constantly, so it is necessary to update laws regularly.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Floor Test</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>Bihar Chief Minister has won the floor test in the Assembly.</p>
<h4>What is a floor test?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A floor test is a measure to check whether the executive is enjoying the confidence of the legislature.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is a constitutional mechanism under which a Chief Minister appointed by the Governor can be asked to prove majority on the floor of the Legislative Assembly of the state.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is it conducted?</h4>
<ul>
<li>As per the Constitution, the Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor of the state.</li>
<li>When a single party secures the majority of the seats in the house, the Governor appoints the leader of the party as the Chief Minister.</li>
<li>In case the majority is questioned, the leader of the party which claims majority has to move a vote of confidence and prove majority among those present and voting.</li>
<li>The Chief Minister has to resign if they fail to prove their majority in the house.</li>
<li>This happens both in the parliament and the state legislative assemblies.</li>
<li>In situations when there are differences within a coalition government, the Governor can ask the Chief Minister to prove majority in the house.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can a floor test be postponed?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court recently had given some respite to some rebel leaders in Maharashtra to respond to the disqualification notice issued by the Speaker.</li>
<li>Citing this as the reason, the original party leaders and loyalists have stated that it is ‘unlawful’ to initiate a floor test when the disqualification decision of the rebel leaders is pending.</li>
<li>However, the previous judgments of the Supreme Court had ruled that the floor test needs not to be deferred even if the decision to disqualify the members is pending.</li>
<li>In the 2020 Shivraj Singh Chouhan v/s Speaker case, the court had clarified the same.</li>
<li>Additionally, the top court had allowed the rebel leaders to skip the floor test during the political crisis in Karnataka in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is composite floor test?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is another test, Composite Floor Test, which is <strong><u>conducted only when more than one person stakes claim to form the government.</u></strong></li>
<li>When the majority is not clear, the governor might call for a special session to see who has the majority.</li>
<li>The majority is counted based on those present and voting. This <strong><u>can also be done through a voice vote</u></strong> where the member can respond orally or through division voting.</li>
<li>Some legislators may be absent or choose not to vote.</li>
<li>In division vote, voting can be done through electronic gadgets, ballots or slips.</li>
<li>The person who has the majority will form the government. In case of tie, the speaker can also cast his vote.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Governors’ discretion</h4>
<ul>
<li>When no party gets a clear majority, the governor can use his discretion in the selection of chief ministerial candidate to prove the majority as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with the floor test</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes ruling party MLAs are lured with rewards, political or otherwise.</li>
<li>Thus, the “floor test” becomes constitutionally immoral and unjust.</li>
<li>This will amount to circumventing the Tenth Schedule through engineered defections through the judicial process.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: No Confidence Motion</h4>
<ul>
<li>The process is explained under rule 198 of the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>Though there is no mention of the term ‘No confidence motion’ or ‘floor test’ in the Constitution, <strong><u>Articles 75 and 164</u></strong> do mention that the executive both at the Centre and state is collectively responsible to their respective legislatures.</li>
<li>Any member from the Opposition can move the no-confidence motion against the ruling government.</li>
<li>The motion has to receive the backing of at least 50 members before it is accepted and subsequently.</li>
<li>A date for the discussion of the motion is announced by the Speaker, which has to be within 10 days from the date of acceptance.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Automatic Number Plate Reader (ANPR)</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Toll collection models in India</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-626097" height="289" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anpr-300x165.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anpr-300x165.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anpr-768x423.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anpr.jpg 879w" width="525"/></p>
<p>In light of congestion at toll plazas, the Road Transport and Highways Ministry is now moving ahead with a plan to replace toll plazas with cameras that could read number plates, also known as Automatic Number Plate Reader (ANPR) cameras.</p>
<h4>ANPR cameras</h4>
<ul>
<li>The plan is to remove toll plazas on national highways and instead rely on ANPR cameras, which will read vehicle number plates and automatically deduct toll from the linked bank accounts of vehicle owners.</li>
<li>The model is simple: Entry and exit of toll roads will have cameras capable of reading number plates, and toll will be deducted based on these cameras.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can all number plates be read by the cameras?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not all number plates in India can be read, and only those that have come after 2019 will be registered by the cameras.</li>
<li>The government, in 2019, had come up with a rule mandating passenger vehicles to have company-fitted number plates, and only these number plates can be read by cameras.</li>
<li>The government plans to come up with a scheme to replace older number plates.</li>
<li>A pilot of this scheme is underway and legal amendments to facilitate this transition are also being moved to penalise vehicle owners who skip toll plazas and do not pay.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Current model for toll collection: FASTags</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently, about 97 per cent of the total toll collection of nearly Rs 40,000 crore happens though FASTags — the remaining 3 per cent pay higher than normal toll rates for not using FASTags.</li>
<li>With FASTags, it takes about 47 seconds per vehicle to cross a toll plaza.</li>
<li>There’s a marked throughput enhancement – more than 260 vehicles can be processed per hour via electronic toll collection lane as compared to 112 vehicles per hour via manual toll collection lane, according to government data.</li>
<li>While FASTags have eased traffic at toll plazas across the country, congestion is still reported as there are toll gates that need to be crossed after authentication.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why such move?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Congestion at toll plazas on national highways continues to impact commuters despite 97 per cent of tolling happening through <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-are-fastags/">FASTags</a>.</li>
<li>Apart from ANPR helping to ease congestion, the government is also looking at GPS technology as one of the options for toll collection.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are there issues with ANPR?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The success of ANPR cameras will depend on creating an ecosystem that is in sync with the requirements of the camera.</li>
<li>The biggest problem being faced during the trials is when things are written on number plates, beyond the nine digit registration number, such as ‘Govt of India/Delhi’ etc.</li>
<li>Another problem that ANPR cameras face is in reading number plates on trucks, as most of the time they are hidden or soiled etc.</li>
<li>A pilot on a key expressway has found that about 10 per cent of vehicles with such number plates are being missed by the ANPR cameras.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: <strong>What is ‘FASTag’?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As per Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, since 1st December 2017, the FASTag had been made mandatory for all registered new four-wheelers and is being supplied by the Vehicle Manufacturer or their dealers.</li>
<li>It has been mandated that the renewal of fitness certificate will be done only after the fitment of FASTag.</li>
<li>For National Permit Vehicles, the fitment of FASTag was mandated since 1st October 2019.</li>
<li>FASTags are stickers that are affixed to the windscreen of vehicles and use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to enable digital, contactless payment of tolls without having to stop at toll gates.</li>
<li>The tags are linked to bank accounts and other payment methods.</li>
<li>As a car crosses a toll plaza, the amount is automatically deducted, and a notification is sent to the registered mobile phone number.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The device employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for payments directly from the prepaid or savings account linked to it.</li>
<li>It is affixed on the windscreen, so the vehicle can drive through plazas without stopping.</li>
<li>RFID technology is similar to that used in transport access-control systems, like Metro smart card.</li>
<li>If the tag is linked to a prepaid account like a wallet or a debit/credit card, then owners need to recharge/top up the tag.</li>
<li>If it is linked to a savings account, then money will get deducted automatically after the balance goes below a pre-defined threshold.</li>
<li>Once a vehicle crosses the toll, the owner will get an SMS alert on the deduction. In that, it is like a prepaid e-wallet.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Vannuramma</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><strong><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-626098" height="300" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vanuramma-265x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vanuramma-265x300.jpg 265w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vanuramma.jpg 389w" width="265"/></strong></p>
<p>The fort of legendry Vannuramma in Nallamala forest in the present day Mydukur mandal of Kadapa district is trending due to its rundown condition.</p>
<h4>Who was Vannuramma?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vannuramma ruled five ‘Durgams’ (under fiefdom) between 1781 and 1796 with Sakarlapadu as the administrative headquarters.</li>
<li>According to historical accounts, she was born in Pathimadugu Rekulakunta, now in Kadapa district, and got married to Veerneni Chinna Narasimha Naidu in 1764.</li>
<li>The family had the practice of praying at Vannuru Swamy temple in Kalyanadurgam of Anantapur district.</li>
<li>Vannuramma thus got her name as she was born, as believed, as the god’s gift.</li>
<li>Though there are not many historical accounts, Kadapa-based writer Bommisetty Ramesh brought out the first book last year on her.</li>
<li>Based on information culled out from the Mackenzie Kaifiyat of Kadapa, he extensively toured the region ruled by her, collected folklore and verified the same with historians.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Her legend</h4>
<ul>
<li>The very mention of the name ‘Vannuramma’ brought chill to the spine of the Matli kings and Kadapa Nawabs.</li>
<li>Of all the Polegars (local chieftains) who had ruled the regional territories of Rayalaseema before the advent of the British, the lone woman ruler remains forgotten from the pages of history.</li>
<li>Under attack from fellow Polegars, Vannuramma’s family fled Thippireddypalle and took shelter in Chagalamarri fort, where they lived for eight years before her husband breathed his last in 1780.</li>
<li>Vannuramma wielded the sword when the Matli king Appayya Raju and Mysore Sultan Hyder Ali’s follower Meeru Saheb waged a war, invaded Sakerlapadu Durgam and robbed the property of locals.</li>
<li>Mobilising her army, she declared a war and brought the territory back into her fold in 1781.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Her death</h4>
<ul>
<li>Even the Golconda Nawabs, through their Kadapa henchman Khadarvali Khan, tried in vain to control her.</li>
<li>It was then they hatched a plan to woo her adopted son and arrested her on some flimsy charges.</li>
<li>When the unsuspecting Vannuramma attended the Matli king’s court to prove her innocence, she was slapped with charges of treason.</li>
<li>The Nawabs captured her and sentenced her with ‘Korthi’, an inhuman form of punishment where a person is made to sit on a sharpened tree stump and left to die.</li>
<li>Vannuramma died in full public view in the year 1718 of Salivahana Saka, which translates to August 16, 1796, i.e., 226 years back.</li>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope, NASA’s latest and most powerful telescope, has captured new images of our solar system’s largest planet, Jupiter, presenting it in a never before seen light.</p>
<h4>What is so special about snapping Jupiter?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The photographs have captured a new view of the planet, presenting in detail its massive storms, colourful auroras, faint rings and two small moons — <strong><u>Amalthea</u></strong> and <strong><u>Adrastea</u></strong>.</li>
<li>While most of us are familiar with the yellow and reddish-brown gas giant.</li>
<li>The JSWT’s Near-Infrared Camera, with its specialized infrared filters, has shown Jupiter encompassed in blue, green, white, yellow and orange hues.</li>
<li>Jupiter’s famous <strong><u>Great Red Spot</u></strong>, a storm so big that it could swallow Earth, appeared bright white in the image, since it was reflecting a lot of sunlight.</li>
<li>The brightness here indicates high altitude — so the Great Red Spot has <strong><u>high-altitude hazes</u></strong>, as does the equatorial region.</li>
<li>The numerous bright white <strong><u>‘spots’ and ‘streaks’</u></strong> are likely very high-altitude cloud tops of condensed convective storms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>About James Webb Space Telescope</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-505370" height="300" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jswt-1-297x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jswt-1-297x300.jpg 297w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jswt-1.jpg 613w" width="297"/></p>
<ul>
<li>JWST is a space telescope jointly developed by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).</li>
<li>It is planned to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA’s flagship astrophysics mission.</li>
<li>It will conduct a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe such as the formation of the first galaxies</li>
<li>Detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets</li>
</ol>
<h4>How is it different from other telescopes?</h4>
<ul>
<li>JWST is much more powerful and has the ability to look in the infrared spectrum, which will allow it to peer through much deeper into the universe, and see through obstructions such as gas clouds.</li>
<li>As electromagnetic waves travel for long distances, they lose energy, resulting in an increase in their wavelength.</li>
<li>An ultraviolet wave, for example, can slowly move into the visible light spectrum and the infrared spectrum, and further weaken to microwaves or radio waves, as it loses energy.</li>
<li>Hubble was designed to look mainly into the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</li>
<li>JWST is primarily an infrared telescope, the first of its kind.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Special features of JWST</strong></h4>
<p><strong>(1) Time machine in space</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful space telescopes, like JWST or the Hubble Telescope, are often called time machines because of their ability to view very faraway objects.</li>
<li>The light coming from those objects, stars or galaxies, which is captured by these telescopes, began its journey millions of years earlier.</li>
<li>Essentially, what these telescopes see are images of these stars or galaxies as they were millions of years ago.</li>
<li>The more distant the planet or star, the farther back in time are the telescopes able to see.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Farthest from Earth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JWST will also be positioned much deeper into space, about a million miles from Earth, at a spot known as L2.</li>
<li>It is one of the five points, known as Lagrange’s points, in any revolving two-body system like Earth and Sun, where the gravitational forces of the two large bodies cancel each other out.</li>
<li>Objects placed at these positions are relatively stable and require minimal external energy to keep them there. L2 is a position directly behind Earth in the line joining the Sun and the Earth.</li>
<li>It would be shielded from the Sun by the Earth as it goes around the Sun, in sync with the Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Engineering marvel</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JWST has one large mirror, with a diameter of 21 feet (the height of a typical two-storey building), that will capture the infra-red light coming in from the deep universe while facing away from the Sun.</li>
<li>It will be shielded by a five-layer, tennis court-sized, kite-shaped sunscreen that is designed to block the heat from Sun and ensure the extremely cool temperatures that the instruments are built to operate at.</li>
<li>Temperatures on the sun-facing side can get as high as 110°C, while the other side would be maintained at –200° to –230°C.</li>
<li>The extremely cold temperatures are needed to detect the extremely faint heat signals from distant galaxies.</li>
<li>The mirror as well as the sunscreen is so large they could not have fit into any rocket. They have been built as foldable items and would be unravelled in space.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Pharma sector malpractices in India</p></div></div><p><img alt="pharma companies" class="alignnone wp-image-626306" height="339" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2-300x160.jpeg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2-300x160.jpeg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2.jpeg 308w" width="636"/>Marketing practices of pharma companies are under scrutiny after tax officials searched the premises of a drugmaker, and an association of medical representatives moved the Supreme Court alleging unethical marketing practices by drugmakers.</p>
<h4><img alt="paharma companies" class="alignnone wp-image-626307" height="415" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-768x513.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma-money-1980x1322.jpg 1980w" width="623"/>The Dolo controversy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bengaluru-based pharmaceuticals company Micro Labs Ltd came under the spotlight recently over the promotion of its anti-fever drug Dolo 650, which was widely used during the covid-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, this drug which contained paracetamol was widely endorsed by doctors all across the India.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court last week ordered the central government to respond to a petition filed on the issue of unethical marketing practices by drug makers.</li>
<li>The Income Tax department too has accused it of claiming unallowable expenses made on freebies meant to boost sales.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/story/pharma-sector/">How do drugmakers incentivize doctors?</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>While many medical professionals claim that financial incentives do not influence their practice, some say that <strong><u>private sector doctors are enticed by pharmaceutical companies’</u></strong> marketing agents to promote their drugs.</li>
<li>Pharma companies’ sales executives visit doctors to brief them about new drugs or a new drug component.</li>
<li>They try to impress upon them to <strong><u>prescribe their brands and in return, doctors are offered some gifts</u></strong> name reminders such as pens, writing pads, books and sometimes expensive gifts and holidays.</li>
<li>Such benefits extended to doctors depend upon the kind of drug, the disease burden etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/a-no-to-pharma-freebies/"><img alt="pharma companies" class="alignnone wp-image-626309" height="382" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pharma.jpeg" width="506"/>Is this a widespread industry practice?</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A government doctor said <strong><u>no pharma firm can sustain without marketing</u></strong> its drug.</li>
<li>It mostly happens when there is an outbreak, or if there is great demand for a particular drug or when a drug is being launched.</li>
<li>Unlike in the case of other products, the decision to buy a drug is not made by the consumer, but by the doctor.</li>
<li>This makes pharma a marketing-driven industry.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are hospitals incentivized too?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes; doctors at a top private hospital which treated a large number of covid-19 patients said drug giants do try to incentivize hospitals.</li>
<li>The possibilities increase when a large corporate hospital chain operating across the country buys a drug in bulk.</li>
<li>A doctor at a corporate hospital does not have any control over the drugs sold in the in-house pharmacy of the hospital.</li>
<li>Doctors running small clinics see limited patients, and they do not have pharmacies; so, the issue of incentivization does not arise.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What does the I-T dept find wrong in this?</h4>
<ul>
<li>While <strong><u>pharma companies treat freebies as a marketing expense</u></strong> which is deducted while computing their taxable income, getting the beneficiary of this spending to report it as his income has been a challenge.</li>
<li>In some cases, <strong><u>tax officials have denied promotional expenses</u></strong> as a deduction.</li>
<li>Hence, the government introduced a 10<strong><u>% tax to be deducted at source (TDS)</u></strong> effective 1 July, so that doctors and social media influencers report such benefits in their tax returns and pay tax on what it is worth.</li>

<ul>
<li>India’s presidency of the G20 grouping next year arguably the sole remaining effective forum for global governance presents an enormous opportunity to accelerate sustainable growth within India, in the emerging world, and beyond.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Formed in 1999, the G20 is an international forum of the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Features </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Collectively, the G20 economies account for around 85 percent of the Gross World Product (GWP), 80 percent of world trade.</li>
<li>To tackle the problems or the address issues that plague the world, the heads of governments of the G20 nations periodically participate in summits.</li>
<li>In addition to it, the group also hosts separate meetings of the finance ministers and foreign ministers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/op-ed-snap-india-must-build-the-capacity-to-make-its-g20-presidency-in-the-future-a-success/"><strong>Objectives</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: The Group was formed with an aim of studying, reviewing, and promoting high-level discussion of policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal responsibilities</strong>: The forum aims to pre-empt balance of payments problems and turmoil on financial markets by improved coordination of monetary, fiscal, and financial policies.</li>
<li><strong>Universal Support:</strong> The forum seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organisation.</li>

<ul>
<li>At some levels, India is ready.</li>
<li>Indian business and industry is becoming a noteworthy competitor globally.</li>
<li>The country’s domestic economy is starting to pick up, thanks to structural economic reforms.</li>
<li>The central government is economically stronger, and the states are starting to learn about economic independence, making them more aligned with their global counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Punchline </strong></h4>
<p><strong>It is said that “those who hold the pen, write the rules”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The time has come for India to both hold the pen and write the rules for a more equitable global economics and governance.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Issues and Challenges</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India need to have a clear global financial agenda.</li>
<li>The country should also have the capacity to lead the G20 year intellectually, financially, managerially and administratively.</li>
<li>Geopolitically, India is more internationally engaged but less so geoeconomically.</li>
<li>Its narrow focus is on the World Bank, IMF, WTO and foreign investment issues.</li>
<li>But India has much to contribute on issues like reconfiguration of global financial regulations, design of a new framework for trade in services and the digital economy and establishing better cross-border standards for transparency in financial flows.</li>
<li>To make its G20 year a success, India has to address organisational challenges, where the country has an infrastructure, management and intellectual gap.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mediation: </strong>Firstly, it remains pertinent for the world that escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine come to a halt. Maintaining its balanced stance, India needs to neutralise this situation by introducing peace talks between the two nations.</li>
<li><strong>Open trade:</strong> It’s about time for India to raise its voice in support of a transparent New Economic Order and building a prosperous and just world. Unreasonable bans on certain commodities from various countries limits commerce between states when trade liberty exists.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration around science and technology: </strong>The global agenda has been tilted towards investment, whereas science and technology are the driving force for economic diversification, sustainably urbanising the world, and ushering the hydrogen economy and new crop varieties as the answer to both human well-being and global climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Redefining digital access as universal service</strong>: Harnessing the potential of the digital-information-technology revolution requires redefining digital access as a “universal service” that goes beyond physical connectivity to sharing specific opportunities available<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s presidency must leave the grouping with the agility and energy to respond to new realities, and it must create a future-ready multilateralism through a novel and robust institutional architecture.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. It is said that “those who hold the pen, write the rules”. The time has come for India to both hold the pen and write the rules for a more equitable global economics and governance. Discuss in the context of India’s presidency of G20 summit with challenges and opportunities ahead.</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Integrated risk assessment of dam safety required to prevent human-made disasters: Experts</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why in news?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The recent floods in the Mahanadi basin in Odisha have brought to the fore, the faulty management of dam safety, which were built to mitigate floods and not be the cause of them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is a dam?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A dam is a barrier that stops the flow of water and results in the creation of a reservoir. Dams are mainly built in order to produce electricity by using water. This form of electricity is known as hydroelectricity.</li>
<li>Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Key facts </strong></h4>
<p>India has 5,745 large dams according to the National Register of Large Dams, 2019, prepared by the Central Water Commission. Some 5,334 of them are operational and the remaining 411 are under construction.</p></blockquote>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/explained-how-india-intends-to-make-its-dams-safer/"><strong>What is the Dam Safety Act, 2021?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Act comprehensively postulates for surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of dams to prevent disasters.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Features</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS):</strong> It will be constituted and will be chaired by the chairperson, Central Water Commission. Its’ functions will include formulating policies and regulations regarding dam safety standards and prevention of dam failures, analyzing the causes of major dam failures, and suggesting changes in dam safety practices.</li>
<li><strong>National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA):</strong> It will be headed by an officer, not below the rank of an Additional Secretary, to be appointed by the central government. The main task of this authority includes implementing the policies formulated by the NCD, resolving issues between State Dam Safety Organisations (SDSOs), or between an SDSO and any dam owner in that state, specifying regulations for inspection and investigation of dams.</li>
<li><strong>State Dam Safety Organisation (SDSO):</strong> Its functions will be to keep perpetual surveillance, inspection, monitoring the operation and maintenance of dams, keeping a database of all dams, and recommending safety measures to owners of dams.</li>
<li><strong>Dam Safety Unit:</strong> The owners of the specified dams are required to provide a dam safety unit in each dam. This unit will inspect the dams before and after the monsoon session, and during and after any calamity or sign of distress.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Action Plan</strong>: Dam owners will be required to prepare an emergency action plan, and carry out risk assessment studies for each dam at specified regular intervals.</li>

<ul>
<li>New evidence from two Kenyan counties shows that universal basic income  and other income supplements reduce hunger, illness, and risk exposure during crises.</li>
<li>Countries should consider building universal basic income that can be activated at short notice to help people weather unanticipated shocks.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why in news?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>When the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting recession pushed 120 million people worldwide into extreme poverty in 2020, many countries relied on social-protection measures to cushion the blow.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is social protection?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Social protection is concerned with preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people’s well-being.</li>
<li>Social protection programs that assist low-income families, insure against shocks, and break poverty traps offer a potential solution.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="universal basic income " class="alignnone wp-image-626176" height="401" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UBI-2-x433-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UBI-2-x433-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UBI-2-x433-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UBI-2-x433.jpg 770w" width="711"/>Universal basic income meaning</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Universal basic income (UBI) is a model for providing all citizens of a country or other geographic area with a given sum of money, regardless of their income, resources or employment status.</li>
<li>The purpose of UBI is to prevent or reduce poverty and increase equality among citizens.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/universalisation-of-social-security-remains-an-unfulfilled-aspiration/"><strong>What is social security?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Social securityin India includes a variety of statutory insurances and social grant schemes bundled into a formerly complex and fragmented system run by the Indian government.</li>
<li>These are retirement, healthcare, disability, childcare, gratuity and provident fund and insurance programs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is insurance simple words?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An agreement by which a person pays a company and the company promises to pay money if the person becomes injured or dies or to pay for the value of property lost or damaged.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Constitutional mandate </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution reflects that India is a welfare state.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Interesting fact </strong></p>
<p><strong>India operates the widest spectrum of social security schemes which cater to the largest number of people than any other country.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/op-ed-snap-ensure-a-minimum-income-for-all/"><strong>What are the benefits of Universal Basic Income?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ending poverty: </strong>Advocates for UBI say that it could help bring everyone’s income above the poverty line.</li>
<li><strong>Discouraging low wages: </strong>UBI would give employees enough security to have bargaining power.</li>
<li><strong>Redistributing wealth: </strong>The economic growth of high-income countries is making the rich richer, but having very little effect on the working classes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Case study / value addition </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Namibia</strong></p>
<p>Namibia had a basic income pilot program between 2008 and 2009. Every resident of Otjivero-Omitara was entitled to 100 Namibian dollars ($6.75) every month. The program was funded by donors from around the world.</p>
<p>Findings from the pilot program showed that cases of child malnutrition had dropped significantly while school enrollment went up. Also, social crimes such as theft had significantly dropped.</p></blockquote>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/op-ed-snapgood-jobs-not-universal-basic-income-are-needed-for-a-good-society/"><strong><img alt="universal basic income " class="alignnone wp-image-626177" height="470" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ubi1.jpeg" width="706"/>Negative implications of UBI</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Induce lethargy: </strong>UBI removes the incentive to work, adversely affecting the economy and leading to a labour and skills shortage.</li>
<li><strong>Inequity:</strong> Universal basic income would be just that: universal. That means that everyone, regardless of how poor, or rich, they were would get the same amount of money.</li>
<li><strong>Huge Cost</strong>: The cost of implementing UBI could be huge. In the United States it’s estimated to be about $3.9 trillion per year.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation to work</strong>: One concern is that UBI would incite millions of workers to stop working. If people aren’t working, there is less taxable income.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Some government initiatives </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>National Pension Scheme for Traders and Self Employed Persons.</li>
<li>Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.</li>
<li>Employees’ State Insurance Scheme.</li>
<li>Minimum Wages for various employment roles.</li>
<li>National Pension System.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the major criticisms of poverty alleviation programs is significant leakages. UBI is seen as a more efficient alternative. Though UBI has many advantages, there are many practical challenges too. The idea should be to save costs with better targeting. This will help create the necessary conditions for higher growth which will decisively lift people out of poverty.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. India operates the widest spectrum of social security schemes which cater to the largest number of people than any other country. Do you think they are enough? Discuss in context of rising demand for universal basic income and its pros and cons for ensuring social security.</strong></p>
