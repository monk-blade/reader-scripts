<ul>
<li>The Prime Minister has called for “Energy Atmanirbharta” by 2040.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is Atmanirbharta?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Atmanirbharta translates literally to self-reliance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the main purpose of Atmanirbhar Bharat?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The aim is to make the country and its citizens independent and self-reliant in all senses. Five pillars of Aatma Nirbhar Bharat are – Economy, Infrastructure, System, Vibrant Demography and Demand.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How to achieve energy self-reliance?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definitional clarity</strong>: Atmanirbharta translates literally to self-reliance. Many interpret it to mean self-sufficiency. That should not be our goal. <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/yojana-archive-energy-security-nuclear-power/">Energy self-sufficiency</a> is infeasible and uneconomic. A better statement of intent would be “strategic autonomy”.</li>
<li><strong>Affordable access to fuel</strong>: Our policy must continue to emphasise affordable and secure access to oil and gas. Part of this objective could be met by intensifying domestic exploration.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritise access to the building blocks of green energy: </strong>The sine qua non for realising this forecast will be cost-competitive access to minerals/components (copper, cobalt, lithium, semiconductor chips etc) required to build EVs, solar panels, wind turbines and batteries.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure development: </strong>We must expand our strategic petroleum reserves to cover at least 30 days of consumption and upgrade the transmission grid and battery storage systems to scale up renewables and smoothen its supplies. We will need to develop innovative financing mechanisms to fund green infrastructure. It should be emphasised that all such investments will get impaired if state discoms are financially insolvent.</li>
<li><strong>Green incentives</strong>: The government’s production-linked incentive scheme (PLI) offers benefits for investment in green energy.</li>
<li><strong>Demand conservation and efficiency: </strong>Energy usage norms must be standardised and tightened. Legislation should be contemplated to ensure compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Energy diplomacy</strong>: Our diplomats should add the arrows of energy diplomacy to their quiver. This is because of our dependence on the international energy supply chains. Success in navigating the cross-currents of economic and geopolitical uncertainties will rest greatly on skilful diplomacy.</li>
<li><strong>Holistic governance</strong>: The current siloed structures of energy governance are suboptimal. A root and branch administrative overall is required. Institutions should be created to facilitate integrated energy planning and implementation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Costa Rica lasted 300 consecutive days on renewable energy alone. Costa Rica set the record in 2017 for most consecutive days with renewable energy. The previous record for this feat was in 2015 when Costa Rica lasted 299 consecutive days on pure, clean energy.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Challenges ahead </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-nuclear public sentiment</strong>: The Fukushima-Daiichi accident resulted in growing concern over the safety of nuclear plants in India .The construction of a nuclear plant in Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu, brought the issue directly into the public domain in 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Management autonomy</strong>: Power sector is dominated by public sector companies or PSUs (owned by the central and state government). Some parts of the energy sector have made very little progress in attracting private investment since 2007.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>: is the key to ensure the commercial viability of business entities and to attract investment into each fuel sector.</li>
<li><strong>Rigid tariff setting mechanism</strong>: Theoretically,  prices should be supervised and adjusted in a timely manner and adequately by independent regulators to reflect changing costs. However, in India, regulators including CERC and SERCs operate in a very rigid way due to political considerations. This jeopardises the operational profitability of companies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We need leadership that can reconcile temporal differences and balance the short-term pressures of elections with the longer-term imperatives of sustainability in energy security which calls for bold and pragmatic decision making by the leadership.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>5 September is teacher’s day. Teachers’ Day or Shikshak Divas marks the birthday of the country’s first Vice President (1952–1962) who went on to become the second President of India (1962-1967), a scholar, philosopher, Bharat Ratna awardee, a highly-respected teacher and prolific statesman – Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="teacher " class="alignnone wp-image-631022" height="216" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/917409a0-f9d2-11eb-a6fe-32d1c824c5de_1628597000407-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/917409a0-f9d2-11eb-a6fe-32d1c824c5de_1628597000407-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/917409a0-f9d2-11eb-a6fe-32d1c824c5de_1628597000407.jpg 550w" width="383"/><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/teaching-the-teacher/">What are the issue with teachers?</a></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less attractive career</strong>: It seems that teaching the young is no longer an attractive profession because systemic conditions are so discouraging. It points towards the reforms that education now requires.</li>
<li><strong>Diversion from teaching:</strong> Teaching children is not regarded as a serious profession. Non-teaching duties are routinely assigned, and now the digital regime has washed away the few traces of professional autonomy even in the best of private schools.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic over vigilance:</strong> So deep is official suspicion of their integrity that many states have installed CCTV cameras in classrooms. That is not the only form of insult teacher’s face. They have little power to assert their professional dignity in the face of bureaucratic or managerial authority.</li>
<li><strong>Marginalisation by coaching institutes: </strong>The Indian school teacher now faces new social and economic forces. Coaching institutions have marginalised the secondary-level science teacher. All over the country, children are allowed to bunk school to attend NEET and JEE coaching classes. Science and math teachers were, in any case, aware that their pedagogic effectiveness would be measured by an unreformed examination system<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reliability issue due to internet overuse: </strong>Social Science teachers are coping with a different kind of challenge to justify their knowledge and interpretation. Children’s access to the internet exposes them to a wilderness of socio-political ideas and information. It is not easy for social science teachers to convince children that they are more reliable than a YouTube video or a WhatsApp message.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Catchy line in this context for value addition</strong></p>
<p><em>Jinke jiwan me guru nahi, unka jiwan abhi shuru nahi.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>How to address these challenges </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supporting teacher control over curriculum and instruction: </strong>Classical top-down school leadership needs to be re-examined, and teachers must be recognized as professionals who have expertise to make good learning decisions for their students.</li>
<li><strong>Establish adequate pay scales and financial incentives: </strong>Compensation systems signal what skills and attributes are valued and what kinds of contributions are rewarded.</li>
<li><strong>Establish and conduct personnel evaluation systems: </strong>Teachers need regular feedback and accurate information on job expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Provide adequate planning time for teachers: </strong>While all teachers work under tremendous time constraints, experienced teachers generally are able to complete their planning more quickly. For new teachers, adequate planning time can allay feelings of being overwhelmed.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a structure for team planning and teaching: </strong>Teachers often report feeling isolated in their classrooms. Team planning and teaching can be an important step in retaining a high quality teaching force.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="teacher " class="alignnone wp-image-631020" height="195" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ded-300x130.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ded-300x130.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ded.jpg 305w" width="449"/>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the teacher is the pivot of the entire educational system and is the main catalytic agent for introducing desirable changes in the teaching learning process, all attempts need be made for motivating teachers to become innovative and creative. It goes without saying that a self-motivated and really industrious teacher can utilise his own resources to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge and skills.</li>

<ul>
<li>Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s four-day visit to India to boost bilateral ties.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/story/foreign-policy-watch-india-bangladesh/"><strong>India-Bangladesh ties background </strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s links with Bangladesh are civilization, cultural, social and economic.</li>
<li>There is much that unites the two countries – a shared history and common heritage, linguistic and cultural ties, passion for music, literature and the arts.</li>
<li>India was one of the first countries, along with Bhutan, to recognise Bangladesh as a sovereign state on 6 December 1971.</li>
<li>It is also worth recalling that India shares its longest border of 4,096.7 kilometres with Bangladesh, which is also the fifth-longest border in the contemporary world.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="bangladesh" class="alignnone wp-image-631046" height="209" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sheikh_Hasina_1662288566031_1662288566150_1662288566150-300x169.jpeg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sheikh_Hasina_1662288566031_1662288566150_1662288566150-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sheikh_Hasina_1662288566031_1662288566150_1662288566150.jpeg 600w" width="371"/>Trade between two</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>CEPA:</strong> Trade will be a focal point during Ms. Hasina’s visit as the two countries gear up to sign a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Bangladesh dependency:</strong> Bangladesh imports critical industrial raw material from India on which its exports are reliant.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Indian support:</strong> Bangladesh also could improve several manufacturing industries by leveraging Indian expertise in service sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="bangladesh" class="alignnone wp-image-631047" height="216" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/download-1.jpeg" width="376"/>Connectivity </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMT highway</strong>: Bangladesh has expressed its interest in joining the India-Myanmar-Thailand highway project.</li>
<li><strong>Waterway</strong>: India-Bangladesh bilateral waterway trade will get boosted as India can now use the Mongla and Chittagong ports.</li>
<li><strong>Logistics</strong>: India’s Northeast and Bangladesh is important for bilateral cooperation. Currently, three express trains and international bus services operate between Indian and Bangladesh.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Key data to remember </strong></h4>
<p>Bangladesh is India’s sixth largest trade partner with bilateral trade rising from $2.4 billion in 2009 to $10.8 billion in 2020-21.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Regional geopolitics</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chinese influence: </strong>Chinese inroads into the neighbourhood have been a cause of worry for India. China has been actively pursuing bilateral ties with Bangladesh. Bangladesh had successfully approached China for a mega project to enhance Teesta river water flow.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic location</strong>: From the perspective of India’s Northeast, Bangladesh is India’s most strategic neighbour, whom New Delhi cannot ever afford to ignore.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperation needed</strong>: India’s dream of ‘Act East Policy’ can only be materialized with the helping hands of Dhaka.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway to northeast</strong>: The bridge ‘Maitri Setu’ has been built over the Feni River which flows between the Indian boundary in Tripura State and Bangladesh. It is set to become the ‘Gateway of North East’ with access to Chittagong Port of Bangladesh, which is just 80 kms from Sabroom.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The future will present itself with an abundance of opportunities to help the two countries to reach a new plane of bilateral relations higher than ever before.</li>
<li>Both nations should play their diplomatic cards with more maturity and pragmatism, keeping the regional aspirations and nuances of both countries in mind.</li>
<li>A judicious aggregation of regional expectations on both sides of the border will help in achieving their mutual national objectives.</li>
<li>To make the recent gains irreversible, both countries need to continue working on the three Cs — cooperation, collaboration, and consolidation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>For India it will take more than cosy relations with one particular government to have long-term stable relations with its most trusted friend in the neighbourhood.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Do you think Bangladesh is most trusted friend in the neighbourhood? Discuss bilateral relations between two in terms of trade, connectivity and geopolitics.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Liquid Nano Urea, a fertilizer patented and sold by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO), has been approved by the government for commercial use because of its potential to substantially reduce the import bill, but several experts have questioned the science underlying its efficacy.</p>
<h4>What is Liquid Nano Urea (LNU)?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Urea is chemical nitrogen fertiliser, white in colour, which artificially provides nitrogen, a major nutrient required by plants.</li>
<li>LNU is essentially urea in the form of a nanoparticle.</li>
<li>It is sprayed directly on the leaves and gets absorbed by the plant.</li>
<li>Fertilisers in nano form provide a targeted supply of nutrients to crops, as they are absorbed by the stomata, pores found on the epidermis of leaves.</li>
<li>According to IFFCO, liquid nano urea contains 4 per cent total nitrogen (w/v) evenly dispersed in water.</li>
<li>The size of a nano nitrogen particle varies from 20-50 nm. (A nanometre is equal to a billionth of a metre.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Using <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-liquid-nano-urea/">LNU</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The liquid nano urea produced by IFFCO Limited comes in a half-litre bottle priced at Rs 240, and carries no burden of subsidy currently.</li>
<li>By contrast, a farmer pays around Rs 300 for a 50-kg bag of heavily subsidised urea.</li>
<li>According to IFFCO, a bottle of the nano urea can effectively replace at least one bag of urea.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How efficient is LNU?</h4>
<ul>
<li>While conventional urea has an efficiency of about 25 per cent, the efficiency of liquid nano urea can be as high as 85-90 per cent.</li>
<li>Conventional urea fails to have the desired impact on crops as it is often applied incorrectly, and the nitrogen in it is vaporized or lost as a gas.</li>
<li>A lot of nitrogen is also washed away during irrigation.</li>
<li>Liquid nano urea has a shelf life of a year, and farmers need not be worried about “caking” when it comes in contact with moisture.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Significance of LNU</h4>
<ul>
<li>This patented product is expected to not only <strong><u>substitute imported urea</u></strong>, but to also <strong><u>produce better results in farms.</u></strong></li>
<li>Apart from <strong><u>reducing the country’s subsidy bill</u></strong>, it is aimed at <strong><u>reducing the unbalanced and indiscriminate use of conventional urea</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It will help <strong><u>increase crop productivity</u></strong>, and reduce soil, water, and air pollution.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why in news now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Plants need nitrogen to make protein and they source almost all of it from soil bacteria which live in a plant’s roots and have the ability to break down atmospheric nitrogen, or that from chemicals such as urea into a form usable by plants.</li>
<li>Chemically packaged urea is 46% nitrogen, which means a 45-kg sack contains about 20 kg of nitrogen.</li>
<li>Contrastingly, nano urea sold in 500-ml bottles has only 4% nitrogen (or around 20 g).</li>
<li>How this can compensate for the kilograms of nitrogen normally required puzzles scientists.</li>
</ul>

<li>This year it will see the participation of more than <strong><u>50,000 troops</u></strong> from <strong><u>13 countries</u></strong> such as India, China, Algeria, India, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and many more.</li>
<li>While the exercises in Vostok-2022 are routine, they are the first such multilateral exercises to be held since the Russian war in Ukraine began.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why in news now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>India has only sent its army contingent and will not take part in the maritime section of the two-part event.</li>
<li>This is because the maritime part of the exercises would be held in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan.</li>
<li>These are near the disputed <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/places-in-news-kuril-islands/">South Kuril Islands</a>.</li>
<li>India’s decision not to take part in the naval exercises is believed to be in deference to Tokyo’s sensitivities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What does India’s participation mean?</h4>
<p>By sending an army contingent to join Russian and Chinese troops in the exercises at this time, New Delhi is aiming to send a four-pronged message:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Continuing relationship with Russia despite the Ukraine war:</strong> The Modi government has decided not to join the Western sanctions regime, or to curb oil imports and other economic engagement with Moscow.</li>
<li><strong>Signal balance and non-alignment in the current crisis:</strong> India has mostly abstained from votes at the United Nations seeking to criticise Russia.</li>
<li><strong>India also takes part in routine Indo-Pacific exercises:</strong> This is with its Western partners including the Quad, as well as in bilateral exercises, like the India-US Ex. Yudh Abhyas.</li>
<li><strong>Willingness to conditional engagement with China:</strong> The message the government continues to give is that it is willing to engage with China on a number of fronts, even as military talks at LAC (Line of Actual Control) remain stuck.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>There might be some discomfort for Indian soldiers in dealing with their counterparts at a time when they are facing each other off along the LAC.</li>
<li>But that’s a small price to pay if it means keeping India-Russia ties on an even keel.</li>
<li>India needs to start communicating its intent better.</li>
<li>Strategic communication is an art. It’s time to master it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Bails</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Different bail provisions</p></div></div><p>An activist recently walked out of a prison, a day after the Supreme Court granted her <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/mudda-aapka-supreme-court-suggests-bail-act/">interim bail</a> in a case of allegedly fabricating evidence related to the 2002 Gujarat riots.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Here we get to know that bail laws in India are not gender neutral. They somewhat favor women due to certain disprivileged social backgrounds.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>What is Bail?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bail is the conditional release of a defendant with the promise to appear in court when required.</li>
<li>The term also means the security that is deposited in order to secure the release of the accused.</li>
<li>In India’s legal world, the term offense has been categorized as bailable offenses and non-bailable under the Code of Criminal Procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why need Bail?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bail is a <strong><u>fundamental aspect</u></strong> of any criminal justice system.</li>
<li>The practice of bail grew out of the need <strong><u>to safeguard the fundamental right to liberty</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Liberty is the right of one whose <strong><u>guilt has not yet been proven</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Types of Bail in India</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Depending upon the sage of the criminal matter, there are commonly three types of bail in India:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regular bail:</strong> Regular bail is generally granted to a person who has been arrested or is in police custody. A bail application can be filed for regular bail under sections 437 and 439 of CrPC.</li>
<li><strong>Interim bail:</strong> This type of bail is granted for a short period of time and it is granted before the hearing for the grant of regular bail or anticipatory bail.</li>
<li><strong>Anticipatory bail:</strong> Anticipatory bail is granted under section 438 of CrPC either by session court or High Court. An application for the grant of anticipatory bail can be filed by the person who discerns that he may be arrested by the police for a non-bailable offense.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Why in news?</strong></h4>
<p>Ans. <strong><u>Favorable treatment for Women</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the hearing, the Supreme Court of India has made an oral observation that under Section 437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), a woman is entitled to favourable treatment.</li>
<li>The provision says that, being a woman is a possible ground for granting bail, even when otherwise it cannot be considered.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does the bail provision say in favor of Women? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Section 437</u></strong> of the CrPC deals with bail in case of non-bailable offences.</li>
<li>It says a person shall not be released on bail if there is reasonable ground to believe that he has committed an offence punishable with <strong><u>death or life imprisonment</u></strong>.</li>
<li>However, it also contains exceptions in a provision that says the court may grant bail even in these cases, “<strong><u>if such person is under the age of 16 or is a woman or is sick or infirm</u></strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Are there other provisions favourable to women accused? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There are several provisions in criminal law that give special consideration to women, of any age, when they are victims of offences, including sexual offences, in the way they are treated as witnesses and victims of crimes.</li>
<li>There are also some provisions relating to women when they are made an accused, and arrested.</li>
<li>For instance, when a police officer requires the attendance of any person who he believes is acquainted with a case under investigation, the person has to appear before the officer (Section 160).</li>
<li>However, no woman shall be required to do so at any place other than the place in which she resides.</li>
<li>This is understood to mean that the officer has to visit the place of residence to make enquiries.</li>
<li>This benefit is also available to boys under 15, men above 65 and any mentally or physically disabled person.</li>
<li>In its 84th and 135th Report in 1980 and 1989, the Law Commission suggested that the word ‘place’ is ambiguous, and it would be better to amend it to ‘dwelling place’.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does the CrPC say on the arrest of a woman? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A police officer <strong><u>may arrest a person who has committed a cognisable offence without a judicial order</u></strong> or a warrant (Section 41).</li>
<li>If the person does not submit to custody based on the word or action of the police, Section 46 enables the police officer to confine the person physically to effect the arrest.</li>
<li>A proviso was introduced in the CrPC in 2009 to the effect that where a woman is to be arrested, <strong><u>only a female police officer may touch the woman’s person</u></strong>, unless circumstances otherwise require.</li>
<li>Earlier, through a 2005 amendment, a subsection was added to Section 46 to <strong><u>prohibit the arrest of a woman after sunset or before sunrise. </u></strong></li>
<li>However, in exceptional circumstances, a woman police officer can obtain the prior permission of a judicial magistrate to make the arrest.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does it say on women who don’t appear in public? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The police <strong><u>may seek entry into any premises</u></strong> where they suspect that a person who is required to be arrested is present.</li>
<li>In a situation where any such place is an apartment in the occupancy of a female (who is not the person to be arrested) and if the woman is one who, by custom, does not appear in public, <strong><u>the police have to give notice to her</u></strong> so that she may withdraw before they enter it (Proviso to Section 47).</li>
<li>It adds that they shall afford her every reasonable facility for withdrawing before they break open and enter the place.</li>
<li>In yet another exception, a woman who intends to file a defamation case, but is one who does not appear in public according to custom, can ask someone else to file the complaint on her behalf.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Ramon Magsaysay</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-631406" height="237" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/magsaysay-300x203.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/magsaysay-300x203.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/magsaysay.jpg 637w" width="350"/></p>
<p>A leftist leader and former Kerala health minister has declined to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award as the late President of the Philippines was known for his alleged brutality against the Communists.</p>
<h4>What is the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lunched in 1958, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, widely considered to be Asia’s equivalent to the Nobel Prize, recognises outstanding leadership and communitarian contributions in Asia.</li>
<li>This year’s annual list of awardees was announced last week.</li>
<li>Shailaja was considered for the award for her performance as state health minister from 2016 to 2021, a period which saw Kerala fight against the Nipah virus and Covid-19.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who was Ramon Magsaysay?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Born on August 31, 1907 to a father who worked as a blacksmith and a mother who was a teacher, Ramon Del Fierro Magsaysay Senior was the seventh president of the Philippines, from 1953 until his death in an air crash in 1957.</li>
<li>Magsaysay started out as an automobile mechanic before being drafted into the Pacific War (1941-1945), during World War II.</li>
<li>The Pacific War would see the Japanese occupation of the Philippines — then a colony of the US — for nearly four years.</li>
<li>The US formally recognised the Philippines as an independent nation in 1946.</li>
</ul>
<h4>His legacy</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a guerrilla leader resisting the Japanese occupation, Magsaysay’s bravery and leadership saw his appointment as a military governor.</li>
<li>In 1946, he would be elected under the Liberal Party to the Philippine House of Representatives, where he would serve two terms as a Congressman before being appointed secretary of National Defence in 1950.</li>
<li>On December 30, 1953, he would be elected president from the Nationalist Party, the oldest political party in the Philippines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Communism and Magsaysay</h4>
<ul>
<li>Founded in 1902, the Unión Obrera Democrática is considered the first modern trade federation in the Philippines.</li>
<li>The Communist Party of the Philippines or the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) was formed in 1930.</li>
<li>The Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon or the People’s Army Against the Japanese, popularly known as the Hukbalahap (Huk), was a prominent guerrilla outfit that fought the Japanese.</li>
<li>As the country plunged into post-war chaos after 1946, the fortunes of the Hukbalahaps, too, changed dramatically.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How he rose to his fame?</h4>
<ul>
<li>With the expansion of capitalism, the gap between the rich and poor widened and the farmers continued to languish.</li>
<li>Huk leaders were viewed with suspicion over their declaration of commitment to communism and the demand for peasant rights.</li>
<li>With the US as its close ally, the Philippine government cracked down on the Huks, who formed an alliance with the PKP to take their struggle to a parliamentary platform.</li>
<li>The severe crackdown against the Huks continued until Magsaysay became the National Defence Secretary under President Elpidio Quirino.</li>
<li>Magsaysay drew upon his own experience of guerrilla warfare to initiate a two-pronged system of reforms and military campaigns.</li>
<li>It was under his administrative and military policies that the Huk threat was considered to be neutralised.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Ramon Magsaysay Award</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1957, the Ramon Magsaysay award was set up by trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Philippine government to carry forward Magsaysay’s legacy of service to the people, good governance, and pragmatic idealism.</li>
<li>In the six decades since 1958 — the first year the Award was given out — over 300 organisations and individuals have been recognised for their developmental endeavours crucial to Asia, and, consequently, to the world.</li>
<li>The award is given out every year on August 31, on Magsaysay’s birth anniversary.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Indian winners on the list</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prominent Indians who have won the award include Vinoba Bhave in 1958, Mother Teresa in 1962, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay in 1966, Satyajit Ray in 1967, Mahasweta Devi in 1997.</li>
<li>In recent years, Arvind Kejriwal (2006), Anshu Gupta of Goonj (2015), human rights activist Bezwada Wilson (2016), and journalist Ravish Kumar (2019) have won the award.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Kurki</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>A farmer in Punjab has committed suicide outside the office of the Muktsar DC against kurki orders for his land based on a court case filed against him by the local moneylender for defaulting on loan payment.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Kurki?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Kurki means attachment of a farmer’s land, already pledged to the money lending institution or individual, in case of a loan default.</li>
<li>Apart from banks, private moneylenders, commission agents also get these decrees against farmers from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How is kurki executed?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Kurki orders are executed under Section 60 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908.</li>
<li>The land which is pledged by the farmer to the bank or money lender gets registered in their name. In some cases, the land is auctioned as well.</li>
<li>The process begins after the money lender moves court to get kurki orders in case the farmer is unable to pay back his loan.</li>
<li>In kurki, attachment of farmer’s land as well as his tractor can be done as per the Section 60.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Was kurki not banned in Punjab?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Both Akali Dal and Congress governments of the past have claimed to have banned kurki.</li>
<li>Congress fought the 2017 Assembly polls on the slogan ‘karza kurki khatam, fasal di poori rakam’.</li>
<li>Soon after winning polls in 2017, the then government abolished Section 67-A of Punjab Cooperative Societies Act that enabled cooperatives to recover unpaid loans through auctioning of land mortgaged by farmers.</li>
<li>However, Section 63-B, 63-C of the Act were not dropped to prevent attachment of land.</li>
<li>Former Punjab CM has also claimed that kurki was abolished by his government. Activists accuses governments of issuing vague orders on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why has a total ban on the century-old kurki law not been achieved?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A plea filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court in 2018 sought complete ban on kurki.</li>
<li>However, the Punjab government in its affidavit stated that there was no need to ban kurki as relief was being given to farmers in terms of loan waiver, compensation etc.</li>
<li>Moreover, it stated that Section 60 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 – under which kurki takes place — was over 110 years old and needed complete revision.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the ground reality?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Farmers point out that they are made to give post-dated cheques for loan, which are then used to get arrest orders issued in cheque bounce cases.</li>
<li>They have also accused money lenders of using pronotes signed by them to get kurki orders.</li>
<li>“Pro-notes” (promissory notes) are written documents taken from farmers, and signed by them at the time of giving the loan.</li>
<li>In April 2022, over 2,000 arrest warrants were issued against farmers for non-payment of loans to cooperative societies and Punjab agriculture development banks.</li>
</ul>

<p>In May this year, some pilgrims offered prayers inside the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/places-in-news-martand-sun-temple/">Martand Temple</a>, an Archaeological Survey of India-protected (ASI) monument</p>
<h4>About Martand Sun Temple</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Martand Sun Temple is a Hindu temple located near the city of Anantnag in the Kashmir Valley.</li>
<li>It dates back to the eighth century AD and was dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity.</li>
<li>The temple was destroyed by Sikandar Shah Miri in a bid to undertake mass conversion and execution of Hindus in the valley.</li>
<li>According to Kalhana, the Temple was commissioned by Lalitaditya Muktapida in the eighth century AD.</li>
<li>The temple is built on top of a plateau from where one can view whole of the Kashmir Valley.</li>
<li>From the ruins the visible architecture seems to be blended with the Gandharan, Gupta and Chinese forms of architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why in news now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to ASI, prayers are allowed at its protected sites only if they were “functioning places of worship” at the time it took charge of them.</li>
<li>No religious rituals can be conducted at non-living monuments where there has been no continuity of worship when it became an ASI-protected site.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the living/non-living monument?</h4>
<ul>
<li>If some activity, like any kind of worship, has been going on for years in the structure, then it is taken over as a living monument.</li>
<li>But where no activity has taken place, say an abandoned building, then it is declared a dead monument.</li>
<li>The latter is difficult to restore because it is generally covered by a lot of overgrowth.</li>
<li>The best-known example of a living ASI monument is the Taj Mahal in Agra, where namaz is held every Friday.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Preamble to the Constitution</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-631405" height="477" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/preamble-219x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/preamble-219x300.jpg 219w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/preamble.jpg 551w" width="348"/></p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear a petition filed by former MP Dr Subramanian Swamy, seeking the removal of the words “Socialist” and “Secular” from the preamble of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The petitioners in two similar cases have argued that these words were never intended to be in the Constitution and that such insertion is beyond the amending power of the Parliament under Article 368.</li>
<li>Similar petitions have been filed earlier too and given rise to debates around the preamble and the role it plays in the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did these words come?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The two terms were inserted into the preamble as part of the <strong><u>42nd Amendment</u> </strong>of the Constitution in<strong> <u>1976</u></strong> <strong><u>during the Emergency</u></strong> imposed by then PM Indira Gandhi.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the purpose of the Preamble?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A preamble serves as an introduction to a document and contains its basic principles and goals.</li>
<li>When the Indian Constitution was being drafted, the ideals behind the preamble were first laid down in the Objectives Resolution, <strong><u>adopted by the Constituent Assembly in 1947</u></strong>.</li>
<li>These ideals emerged out of the numerous debates that took place during the drafting of the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, the Preamble said:</p>
<p>“WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:</p>
<p>JUSTICE, social, economic and political;</p>
<p>LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;</p>
<p>EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;</p>
<p>And to promote among them all</p>
<p>FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the Nation;</p>
<p>IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.”</p>
<h4>Nature of the preamble</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Constitution was the product of democratic deliberations and decided upon by the people of India themselves in the wake of freedom from colonial rule.</li>
<li>The ideals mentioned here were at the core of the newly democratic nation.</li>
<li>During the Constituent Assembly debates, many suggestions were put forth — including that God should be invoked in the preamble as in the Irish constitution, that Mahatma Gandhi’s name should be included, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a part of the Constitution?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The question of whether the preamble is a part of the Constitution or simply an introduction has been deliberated upon by the highest court.</li>
<li>This is because the meaning and weight of the objectives mentioned in it, such as equality of status and opportunity, remained unclear from the perspective of law.</li>
<li>However, in its judgment in the famous LIC case of 1995, the Supreme Court said and the Preamble of the Constitution which is an <strong><u>integral part and scheme of the Constitution</u></strong>, affirming its position as part of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Additionally, the violation of any principle mentioned in the preamble cannot be a reason to go to court, meaning the preamble is “<strong><u>non-justiciable</u></strong>”.</li>
<li>However, judgments of courts can cite it as an additional factor in their reasoning, given that it <strong><u>constitutes the spirit of the Constitution</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How else has the preamble been debated earlier?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2020 a ruling MP has moved a resolution in Rajya Sabha seeking to remove the word socialism from the preamble.</li>
<li>It said, that the earlier party which ruled the country for seven decades has changed its direction from being socialist to welfare to neo-liberalism.</li>
<li>Its new liberal policies adopted in the 1990s have negated its own earlier positions.</li>
<li>Earlier in 2015, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting used an image of the preamble of the Indian Constitution without the words “socialist” and “secular”, leading to some criticism.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the right-wing narrative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>These words were added during the Emergency. Now what is the harm if there is a debate on it?</li>
<li>In 2008, the Supreme Court rejected a plea demanding the removal of ‘socialist’.</li>
<li>The apex court asked-Why do you take socialism in a narrow sense defined by Communists?</li>
<li>In a broader sense, it means welfare measures for the citizens. It is a facet of democracy, said the Court.</li>
<li>It hasn’t got any definite meaning. It gets different meanings in different times.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Under what circumstances was the preamble amended?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Over her years in government, Indira Gandhi had attempted to cement her approval among the masses on the basis of a socialist and pro-poor image with slogans such as “garibi hatao” (Eradicate poverty).</li>
<li>The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, passed in 1976 when the Emergency was in place, replaced the words “sovereign democratic republic” with “sovereign socialist secular democratic republic”.</li>
<li>It also changed “unity of the nation” to “unity and integrity of the nation”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Were ‘Secular’ and ‘Socialist’ debated before Independence?</h4>
<ul>
<li>During the debates in the Constituent Assembly, members such as K T Shah and Brajeshwar Prasad had raised the demand to add these words to the preamble.</li>
<li>However, Dr B R Ambedkar argued: What should be the policy of the State, how the Society should be organised in its social and economic side are matters which must be decided by the people themselves according to time and circumstances.</li>
<li>It cannot be laid down in the Constitution itself because that is destroying democracy altogether.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it inclusive of the Constitution?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Indeed, many principles affirming secularism and socialism were contained in the Constitution originally, such as in the Directive Principles of State Policy that is meant to guide the government in its actions.</li>
<li>Some examples are provisions related to the “equitable distribution of material resources of the community for the common good”, and protecting the rights of workers.</li>
<li>Similarly, in the fundamental rights that allow the freedom to profess and propagate one’s religion, as well as in the government policies that recognize religious occasions across communities, an Indian version of secularism is followed.</li>
<li>Unlike western secularism which strictly separates the state and religion, the Indian state has over the years acknowledged and involved itself in matters related to all religions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Article 130, Circuit Court</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Judicial accessibility</p></div></div><p>TN Chief Minister yet again reiterated the State’s request for establishing a <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/the-idea-of-regional-supreme-court-benches/">Regional Bench of the Supreme Court</a> in Chennai and allowing Tamil to be used in the Madras High Court as one of its official languages.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing Vice President, M Venkaiah Naidu suggested bifurcation of the Supreme Court into four regional benches for speedy disposal of cases.</li>
<li>However, the Supreme Court has maintained on previous occasions that there is no need for such benches outside Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why the Supreme Court is located in New Delhi?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Article 130</u></strong> of the Constitution of India reads- The <strong><u>Supreme Court shall sit in Delhi or in such other place or places</u></strong>, as the <strong><u>Chief Justice of India</u></strong> may, with the approval of the President, from time to time, appoint.</li>
<li>The law thus provides scope for setting up the Supreme Court in multiple places, subject to the concurrence of the CJI and the President.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who can establish the SC benches outside New Delhi?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court in <strong><u>Union of India v. S.P. Anand Verdict</u></strong><u> (2009)</u>, held that the Article vests exclusive discretionary powers on the matter with the Chief Justice of India.</li>
<li>It is an enabling provision and if the Chief Justice (after taking relevant factors into account) feels that the Court should sit elsewhere, s/he can seek the President’s approval for it.</li>
<li>No authority can compel the <strong><u>Chief Justice of India</u></strong> to act in a particular way under the Article.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Voices for circuit benches</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><u>Law Commission in its 229th Report</u></strong> had suggested setting up a Constitution Bench of the Court in New Delhi and four other benches in different regions i.e., Northern region in Delhi, Southern region in Chennai/Hyderabad, Easter region in Kolkata and Western region in Mumbai.</li>
<li>However, this idea did not find favour with the Judges of the Supreme Court.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reasons for having Regional/Circuit Benches</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access to Justice:</strong> Many litigants are discouraged to travel to Delhi from far away locations like south or northeast India.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographical Constraints:</strong> A disproportionately high number of cases filed in the Supreme Court originated in High Courts closer to Delhi. Hence coming up with regional benches will remove this constraint.</li>
<li><strong>Huge pendency of cases: </strong>Increased workload on the Supreme Court and at present more than 65,000 cases are pending in the Supreme Court, and disposal of appeals takes many years.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Cost of Justice: </strong>It is observed that besides travelling to New Delhi, engaging expensive Supreme Court counsel to pursue a case is beyond the means of most litigants.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advantages of having circuit courts</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotes Article 39A:</strong> It has been pointed out that Article 39A says that the state shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Geographical Constraints:</strong> It is high time we had more benches because in a country as vast as India the litigants have to travel long distances and spend a huge amount of money and energy.</li>
<li><strong>Upholding the spirit of the constitution:</strong> Setting up Benches outside Delhi would neither impair unity and integrity nor undermine the importance of the Supreme Court.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Dark Sky Reserve</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-631404" height="262" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dark-sky-300x149.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dark-sky-300x149.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dark-sky.jpg 668w" width="528"/></p>
<p>In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) has announced the setting up of India’s first dark sky reserve at Hanle in Ladakh in the next three months.</p>
<h4>What is a Dark Sky Reserve?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A dark-sky reserve is an area, usually surrounding a park or observatory that is kept free of artificial light pollution.</li>
<li>The purpose of a dark sky preserve is generally to promote astronomy.</li>
<li>Because different national organizations have worked independently to create their programs, different terms have been used to describe the areas.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is it designated?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A dark sky reserve is a designation given to a place that has policies in place to ensure that a tract of land or region has minimal artificial light interference.</li>
<li>The International Dark Sky Association is a US-based non-profit that designates sites as international dark sky places, parks, sanctuaries and reserves, depending on the criteria they meet.</li>
<li>Several such reserves exist around the world but none so far in India.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dark Sky Reserve at Hanle</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hanle, which is about 4,500 metres above sea level, hosts telescopes and is regarded as one of the world’s most optimal sites for astronomical observations.</li>
<li>However, ensuring that the site remains well-suited for astronomy implies keeping the night sky pristine, or ensuring minimal interference to the telescopes from artificial light sources such as electric lights and vehicular lights from the ground.</li>
<li>The site will have activities to help in boosting local tourism and economy through interventions of science and technology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>The Himalayan Chandra Telescope, High Energy Gamma Ray Telescope, Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment Telescope and GROWTH-India are the prominent telescopes located at the Hanle observatory.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>Ideal conditions in India</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Astronomical Observatory, the high-altitude station of the IIA, is situated to the north of Western Himalayas, at an altitude of 4,500 metres above mean sea level.</li>
<li>Located atop Mt. Saraswati in the Nilamkhul Plain in the Hanle Valley of Changthang, it is a dry, cold desert with sparse human population.</li>
<li>The cloudless skies and low atmospheric water vapour make it one of the best sites in the world for optical, infrared, sub-millimetre, and millimetre wavelengths.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (IAD)</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-631403" height="208" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/reusable-300x148.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/reusable-300x148.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/reusable-768x378.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/reusable.jpg 984w" width="422"/></p>
<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully tested a technology that could aid the cost-effective recovery of spent rocket stages and safely land payloads on other planets.</p>
<h4>What is IAD?</h4>
<ul>
<li>IAD is a technique used for an <strong><u>atmospheric entry payload</u></strong>.</li>
<li>An <strong><u>inflatable envelope and an inflatant</u></strong> (anything that inflates the envelope, like air or helium) make up the inflatable aerodynamic decelerator.</li>
<li>While entering the atmosphere, it <strong><u>inflates like a balloon and decelerates the lander. </u></strong></li>
<li>The inflatant is designed to fill the inflatable envelope to a condition such that it surrounds the payload meant to enter the atmosphere of a planet or satellite and causes aerodynamic forces to slow it down.</li>
<li>In simpler words, IAD is designed to increase drag upon entering the atmosphere of any planetary body, like Earth, Mars, or even Moon.</li>
<li>Its shape is maintained by a closed, gas-pressured body and the inflatant gas is also generated internally. Some versions also use ram air or both.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How significant is this IAD?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some space agencies, including NASA, have already successfully tested advanced versions of the technology, including the supersonic and hypersonic variants.</li>
<li>However, for near future missions of ISRO, the current version that it tested is perfect.</li>
<li>Its use was first proposed by NASA more than 50 years ago for planetary entries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minuscule of ISRO’s IAD</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAD tested by ISRO was inflated at an <strong><u>altitude of around 84 km</u></strong> and the sounding rocket’s cargo dropped through the atmosphere on it.</li>
<li>It is fitted with a <strong><u>booster motor</u></strong>. It also has a <strong><u>spin rocket</u></strong> that is ejectable.</li>
<li>The inflatable structure is made out of <strong><u>Kevlar fabric</u></strong>, which is a very strong synthetic fibre and also heat resistant to withstand atmospheric pressure and temperature changes.</li>
<li>On top of it, it’s coated with <strong><u>polychloroprene</u></strong>, an oil and wax resistant rubber, to <strong><u>withstand extreme temperatures. </u></strong></li>
<li>In the inflation system, it <strong><u>uses compressed nitrogen</u></strong> stored in a bottle.</li>
<li>It has consistently <strong><u>decreased the payload’s velocity</u></strong> through <strong><u>aerodynamic drag</u></strong> while maintaining the expected trajectory during the test flight.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where does ISRO intend to use it?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAD will help ISRO in performing many space tasks effectively including recovery of spent stages of rockets, for landing payloads on missions to other planetary bodies.</li>
<li>This is the first instance where an IAD has been specially created for spent stage recovery.</li>
<li>So inter-planetary missions are certainly one aspect that ISRO wishes to explore.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Lokpal and Lokayukta</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The Kerala Legislative Assembly passed the Kerala Lok Ayukta (Amendment) Bill on August 30, amid a boycott.</p>
<h4>Who are Lokpal-Lokayuktas?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Lokpal-Lokayukta issue has always generated intense debate in the country.</li>
<li>In fact, this term was <strong><u>first used</u></strong> in a report of the <strong><u>Administrative Reforms Commission </u></strong>headed by <strong><u>Morarji Desai</u></strong> as far back as in <strong><u>1966</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Political corruption had become rampant by then and it was thought that a credible system of an ombudsman should be established to redress public grievances against the leaders and public officials.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>first Bill on Lokpal</u></strong> was <strong><u>introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1968</u></strong> which <strong><u>lapsed</u></strong> with the dissolution of the House.</li>
<li><strong><u>Anna Hazare’s movement</u></strong> and the active involvement of civil society generated a lot of moral pressure on the Government which ultimately led to the <strong><u>passing of the Bill in 2013</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Composition of Lokpal</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Lokpal is no ordinary investigative body.</li>
<li>It is headed by the incumbent Chief Justice of India or a retired judge.</li>
<li>It has eight members, four of whom are judicial members.</li>
<li>Thus the whole system is studded with judges or judicial men.</li>
<li>The Lokpal has an inquiry wing and a prosecution wing to deal with investigation and prosecution, respectively.</li>
<li>The director of prosecution files the case in the special court based on the findings of the Lokpal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who falls under the ambit of Lokpal?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Lokpal has jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of corruption against the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Group A, B, C and D officers and officials of the central government.</li>
<li>After the conclusion of the investigation, the Lokpal may file a case in the special court in case the findings disclose the commission of offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act by the PM, Ministers or MPs.</li>
<li>However, the Lokpal does not have the power to ask the President to remove the Prime Minister or a Minister from office.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What about the states?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Lokpal and Lokayukta Act delegates the power to States to establish by law the Lokayukta to deal with complaints relating to corruption against public functionaries.</li>
<li>Some States already have established Lokayuktas. For example, Maharashtra in 1971, and Kerala in 1999.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the Keralan controversy?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In order to get a clearer perspective on the Kerala Lokayukta controversy, it is necessary to understand the scheme of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act enacted by Parliament.</li>
<li>The long title of the Act says: “An Act to provide for the establishment of a body of Lokpal for the Union and Lokayukta for States to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries….”</li>
<li>Thus, the Lokpal is conceived of as a body which will inquire into allegations of corruption.</li>
<li>It is basically an investigative body whose task is to conduct prompt and fair investigation and the prosecution of cases of corruption.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with the Amendment</h4>
<ul>
<li>The amendments were related to the competent authority to consider Lok Ayukta recommendations.</li>
<li>In the case of any unfavourable <strong><u>decision from the Lok Ayukta against the CM, the competent authority will now be the Legislative Assembly instead of the Governor</u></strong> as is prescribed in the existing Act.</li>
<li>The amendment tries to <strong><u>take away at the powers of the Governor</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>Lokayukta has indirectly expressed its resentment</u></strong> over the attempt to take away some of its powers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Arguments by Kerala Government</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Government, on the other hand, claims that through the amendment, a provision in the original Act which is unconstitutional has been excised.</li>
<li>Earlier it gave power to the <strong><u>Lokayukta to give directions to the Governor to remove a CM</u></strong> or a Minister on being found guilty of corruption.</li>
<li>This meant that the Lokayukta was to be over and above the office of Governor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Legal and constitutional implications</h4>
<p>Two important points need to be made here:</p>
<p><strong>(A) Overpowering the Lokpal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One, an investigative body does not have the legal authority to direct the public servant to resign his post on the basis of its findings.</li>
<li>It can only submit its findings to the competent authority or, as is provided in the Lokpal Act, file a case in the special court.</li>
<li>The Lokayukta is basically an investigative body with certain powers to carry out an investigation into cases relating to the Prevention of Corruption Act.</li>
<li>The only special feature of this body is that it is headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court or a retired Chief Justice of a High Court.</li>
<li>But that does not alter the basic character of the Lokayukta as an investigative body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(B) Compulsion on Governor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chief Minister or a Minister holds office during the pleasure of the Governor (Article 164).</li>
<li>The Constitution of India does not contemplate any external pressure on the Governor to withdraw his pleasure.</li>
<li>The Sarkaria Commission had suggested that the Governor can dismiss a Chief Minister only when he loses his majority in the Assembly and refuses to step down.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court has accepted this recommendation of the Sarkaria Commission.</li>
<li>Another occasion when the Governor could withdraw his pleasure is on account of CM having been convicted in a criminal case and sentenced to not less than two years of imprisonment.</li>
<li>In other words, a Chief Minister cannot be asked to resign when he enjoys a majority in the House.</li>
<li>The Governor, being a high constitutional authority, cannot be compelled by a law to act in a particular manner so far as his constitutional duties and functions are concerned.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other contentious provisions</h4>
<p><strong>(1) Undue burden on Political Parties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are some other provisions as well which may not stand legal scrutiny.</li>
<li>For example, this law includes the office bearers of political parties within its definition of ‘public servant’.</li>
<li>Basically, the Prevention of Corruption Act deals with corruption in the government and allied agencies, statutory bodies, elected bodies, etc.</li>
<li>The functionaries of political parties do not come within the mischief of this law. So, it is difficult to understand how they can be brought within the sweep of the Lokayukta Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Reports of Lokayukta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Another problematic provision in this law is the one which deals with the reports of Lokayukta (Section 12).</li>
<li>It says that the Lokayukta shall, on the allegation of corruption being substantiated, send the findings along with recommendation of action to the competent authority who is required to take action as recommended by the Lokayukta.</li>
<li>It further says that if the Lokayukta is satisfied by the action taken by the competent authority, he shall close the case.</li>
<li>The question is how the Lokayukta can close a corruption case which is a criminal case and which invites imprisonment for three to seven years.</li>
<li>The Lokpal files the case in the court after the investigation. There is no provision in the central law under which the Lokpal can close the case before it reaches the court.</li>
<li>The Lokayukta not being a court does not have the legal capacity to close the corruption case under any circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Kerala Lokayukta Act should be re-examined by a committee of the Assembly and should be brought on a par with the Lokpal Act.</li>
<li>Legislation that seeks to punish corrupt functionaries should be placed above controversies.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4><strong>Back2Basics: Lokpal Movement</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Lokpal, the apex body to inquire and investigate graft complaints against public functionaries, came into being with the appointment of its chairperson and members in March 2019.</li>
<li>In March 2019, former SC judge Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose was selected as the first head of the Lokpal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lokpal Act 2013 is anti-corruption legislation that seeks to provide for the establishment of the institution of Lokpal.</li>
<li>It seeks to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain important public functionaries including the PM, cabinet ministers, MPs, Group A officials of the Central Government, etc.</li>
<li>The Bill was introduced in the parliament following massive public protests led by anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare and his associates.</li>
<li>The Bill is one of the most widely discussed and debated Bills in India in recent times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Its history</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The term Lokpal was coined in 1963 by Laxmi Mall Singhvi, a member of parliament during a parliamentary debate about grievance mechanisms.</li>
<li>The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) headed by Morarji Desai submitted an interim report on “Problems of Redressal of Citizen’s Grievances” in 1966.</li>
<li>In this report, ARC recommended the creation of two special authorities designated as ‘Lokpal’ and ‘Lokayukta’ for a redress of citizens’ grievances.</li>
<li>Maharashtra was the first state to introduce Lokayukta through The Maharashtra Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas Act in 1971.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heavy floods in Pakistan has pushed the archeological site of Mohenjo Daro – near the bank of the Indus river – to the “brink of extinction”.</p>
<h4>What is the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pakistan’s Department of Archaeology has said that Mohenjo Daro might be removed from the world heritage list, if urgent attention towards its conservation and restoration is not given.</li>
</ul>
<h4>About Mohenjo Daro</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mohenjo Daro, a group of mounds and ruins, is a 5000-year-old archaeological site located about 80-km off the city of Sukkur.</li>
<li>It comprises the remnants of one of two main centres of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, the other one being Harappa, located 640 km to the northwest, in Punjab province.</li>
<li>Mohenjo Daro, which means ‘mound of the dead’, was one of the oldest cities of the world.</li>
<li>Known to be a model planned city of the ancient civilisation, the houses here had bathrooms, toilets and drainage system.</li>
<li>The sheer size of the city, and its provision of public buildings and facilities, suggests a high level of social organization.</li>
<li>Though in ruins, the walls and brick pavements in the streets are still in a preserved condition.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did it came to prominance</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3,700 years, until 1920, when archaeologist RD Banerji visited the site.</li>
<li>Its excavation started in 1921 and continued in phases till 1964-65.</li>
<li>The site went to Pakistan during Partition.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Indus Valley sites</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-631667" height="367" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ivcs-300x237.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ivcs-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ivcs.jpg 665w" width="465"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indus Valley Civilisation spanned much of what is now Pakistan and the northern states of India (Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan), even extending towards the Iranian border.</li>
<li>Its major urban centres included Harappa and Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan, and Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi in India.</li>
<li>Mohenjo Daro is considered the most advanced city of its time, with sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning.</li>
<li>When the Indus Valley Civilisation went into sudden decline around 19th century BC, Mohenjo Daro was abandoned.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What next for the site</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to media reports, many streets and sewerage drains of the historical ruins have been badly damaged due to the floods.</li>
<li>However, the work of removing the sediments deposited due the flooding is still underway.</li>
<li>But if this kind of flooding happens again, the heritage site may once again get buried under the ground, archaeologists say.</li>
<li>It is expected that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will visit the site during his visit to Pakistan on September 11.</li>
<li>The visit might provide some clarity on if the site has lost some of its attributes that are necessary for it to retain its prestigious world heritage tag.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Losing world heritage tag</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are around 1,100 UNESCO listed sites across its 167 member countries.</li>
<li>Last year, the World Heritage Committee decided to delete the property ‘Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City’ (UK) from the World Heritage List.</li>
<li>This was due to the irreversible loss of attributes conveying the outstanding universal value of the property.</li>
<li>Liverpool was added to the World Heritage List in 2004 in recognition of its role as one of the world’s major trading centres in the 18th and 19th centuries – and its pioneering dock technology, transport systems and port management.</li>
<li>Before that, the first venue to be delisted by the UNESCO panel was the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in Oman, in 2007, after concerns over poaching and habitat degradation.</li>
<li>Another site to be removed from the World Heritage list in 2009 was Elbe Valley in Dresden, Germany, after the construction of the Waldschloesschen road bridge across the Elbe River.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h4>
<ul>
<li>A World Heritage Site is a landmark or area, selected by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for having cultural, historical, scientific or other forms of significance, which is legally protected by international treaties.</li>
<li>The sites are judged to be important for the collective and preservative interests of humanity.</li>
<li>To be selected, a WHS must be an already-classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or wilderness area).</li>
<li>It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet.</li>
<li>The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence.</li>
<li>The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, composed of 21 “states parties” that are elected by their General Assembly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UNESCO World Heritage Committee</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The World Heritage Committee selects the sites to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger.</li>
<li>It monitors the state of conservation of the World Heritage properties, defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties.</li>
<li>It is composed of 21 states parties that are elected by the General Assembly of States Parties for a four-year term.</li>
<li>India is <strong>NOT</strong> a member of this Committee.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Purchasing Managers’ Index</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>The services sector rebounded in August from a four-month low in July and created the most jobs in 14 years as input cost pressures eased to the slowest pace in 11 months, as per S&amp;P Global India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which expanded to 57.2 last month, from July’s 55.5.</p>
<h4>Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)</h4>
<ul>
<li>PMI is an indicator of business activity — <strong><u>both in the manufacturing </u></strong><u>and<strong> services sectors</strong></u>.</li>
<li>It is a survey-based measure that asks the respondents about changes in their perception of some key business variables from the month before.</li>
<li>It is calculated separately for the manufacturing and services sectors and then a composite index is constructed.</li>
<li>The PMI is compiled by IHS Markit based on responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is the PMI derived?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The PMI is derived from a series of qualitative questions.</li>
<li>Executives from a reasonably big sample, running into hundreds of firms, are asked whether key indicators such as output, new orders, business expectations and employment were stronger than the month before and are asked to rate them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does one read the PMI?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A figure above 50 denotes expansion in business activity. Anything below 50 denotes contraction.</li>
<li>Higher the difference from this mid-point greater the expansion or contraction. The rate of expansion can also be judged by comparing the PMI with that of the previous month data.</li>
<li>If the figure is higher than the previous month’s then the economy is expanding at a faster rate.</li>
<li>If it is lower than the previous month then it is growing at a lower rate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are its implications for the economy?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The PMI is usually released at the start of the month, much before most of the official data on industrial output, manufacturing and GDP growth becomes available.</li>
<li>It is, therefore, considered a good leading indicator of economic activity.</li>
<li>Economists consider the manufacturing growth measured by the PMI as a good indicator of industrial output, for which official statistics are released later.</li>
<li>Central banks of many countries also use the index to help make decisions on interest rates.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Sexual orientation as medical condition</p></div></div><p><strong><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-631657" height="300" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/conversion-298x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/conversion-298x300.jpg 298w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/conversion-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/conversion.jpg 382w" width="298"/></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/importance-of-medical-education/">National Medical Commission (NMC)</a>, the apex regulatory body of medical professionals in India, has written to all State Medical Councils, banning sexual conversion therapy and calling it a “professional misconduct”.</p>
<h4>What is the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The NMC has empowered the <strong><u>State bodies to take disciplinary action against medical professionals</u></strong> who breach the guideline.</li>
<li>The NMC was following a <strong><u>Madras High Court directive </u></strong>to issue an official notification listing conversion therapy as a wrong, under the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquettes and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is Sexual Conversion Therapy?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conversion or reparative therapy is an <strong><u>intervention aimed at changing the sexual orientation</u></strong> or gender identity of an individual.</li>
<li>It uses either <strong><u>psychiatric treatment, drugs, exorcism and even violence</u></strong>, with the aim being to make the individual a heterosexual.</li>
<li>The conversion therapy umbrella also includes efforts to change the core identity of youth whose gender identity is incongruent with their sex anatomy.</li>
<li>Often, the therapy is offered by quacks with little expertise in dealing with the issue.</li>
<li>As late as 2018, medical books listed homosexuality and lesbianism as a “<strong><u>perversion</u></strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the risks?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The interventions under conversion therapy are provided under the <strong><u>false premise</u></strong> that homosexuality and diverse gender identities are pathological.</li>
<li>They are not; the absence of pathology means there is no need for conversion or any other like intervention.</li>
<li>Conversion therapy poses the <strong><u>risk of causing or exacerbating mental health conditions</u></strong>, like anxiety, stress and drug use which sometimes even lead to suicide.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the role of the Madras High Court in the ban?</h4>
<p>On June 7, 2021, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the Madras High Court gave a landmark ruling on a case he was hearing about the ordeal of a same-sex couple who sought police protection from their parents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pending adequate legislation more protective of the community, Justice Venkatesh issued a slew of <strong><u>interim guidelines</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It aimed for the <strong><u>police, activists, Union and State Social Welfare Ministries</u></strong>, and the National Medical Commission to ensure their safety and security to lead a life chosen by them.</li>
<li>The ruling <strong><u>prohibited any attempt to medically “cure”</u></strong> or change the sexual orientation of LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual or of any other orientation) people.</li>
<li>It urged the authorities to take <strong><u>action against professionals</u></strong> involving themselves in any form or method of conversion therapy,” which could include the withdrawal of licence to practice medicine.</li>
<li>On July 8, 2022, the court gave an <strong><u>order to the NMC directing</u></strong> it to issue necessary official notification by enlisting ‘Conversion Therapy’ as a <strong><u>professional misconduct</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What were some of the other guidelines issued by the court?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The court asked the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment to d<strong><u>raw up a list of NGOs and other groups which could handle the issues </u></strong>faced by the community, and gave it a time of 8 weeks from the date of the order.</li>
<li>The court said the <strong><u>community should be provided with legal assistance</u></strong> by the District Legal Services Authority in coordination with law enforcement agencies.</li>
<li>It asked <strong><u>agencies to follow</u></strong> the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020, and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, <strong><u>in letter and spirit</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The court said it was imperative to <strong><u>hold sensitisation programmes</u></strong> for an all-out effort to understand the community and its needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Schools and colleges</u></strong> must effect changes in curricula for a better understanding of the community.</li>
<li>People of a different sexual orientation or gender identity often narrate harrowing tales of bullying, <strong><u>discrimination, stigma and ostracization</u></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>Gender-neutral restrooms</u></strong> should be compulsory in educational institutes and other places.</li>
<li><strong><u>Parents too need to be sensitised</u></strong>, because the first point of misunderstanding and abuse often begins at home, with teenagers being forced to opt for “conversion” therapies.</li>
<li>Health professionals point out that even adults opting for sex reassignment surgeries need to get proper <strong><u>guidance like</u></strong> <strong><u>therapy pre and post operation</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019: Key Features</h4>
<p><strong>Defining Transperson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The act defines a transgender person as one whose gender does not match the gender assigned at birth.</li>
<li>It includes trans-men and trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons with socio-cultural identities, such as kinnar and hijra.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prohibition against discrimination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It prohibits the discrimination against a transgender person, including denial of service or unfair treatment in relation to education, employment, healthcare, access to, or enjoyment of goods, facilities, opportunities available to the public.</li>
<li>Every transgender person shall have a right to reside and be included in his household.</li>
<li>No government or private entity can discriminate against a transgender person in employment matters, including recruitment, and promotion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HRD measures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A transgender person may make an application to the District Magistrate for a certificate of identity, indicating the gender as ‘transgender’.</li>
<li>Educational institutions funded or recognised by the relevant government shall provide inclusive facilities for transgender persons, without discrimination.</li>
<li>The government must provide health facilities to transgender persons including separate HIV surveillance centres, and sex reassignment surgeries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grievances redressal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The National Council for Transgender persons (NCT) chaired by Union Minister for Social Justice, will advise the central government as well as monitor the impact of policies with respect to transgender persons.</li>
<li>It will also redress the grievances of transgender persons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Protection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bill imposes penalties for the offences against transgender persons like bonded labour, denial of use of public places, removal from household &amp; village and physical, sexual, verbal, emotional or economic abuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Eurozone is almost certainly entering a recession, with surveys showing a deepening cost-of-living crisis and a gloomy outlook that is keeping consumers wary of spending.</p>
<h4>What is Recession?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/imf-flags-recession-risk/">recession</a> is a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for months or even years.</li>
<li>Experts declare a recession when a nation’s economy experiences negative GDP, rising levels of unemployment, falling retail sales, and contracting measures of income and manufacturing for an extended period of time.</li>
<li>Recessions are considered an unavoidable part of the business cycle—or the regular cadence of expansion and contraction that occurs in a nation’s economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What causes Recessions?</h4>
<p>These phenomena are some of the main drivers of a recession:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden economic shock:</strong> An economic shock is a surprise problem that creates serious financial damage. The coronavirus outbreak, which shut down economies worldwide, is a more recent example of a sudden economic shock.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive debt:</strong> When individuals or businesses take on too much debt, the cost of servicing the debt can grow to the point where they can’t pay their bills. Growing debt defaults and bankruptcies then capsize the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Asset bubbles:</strong> When investing decisions are driven by emotion, bad economic outcomes aren’t far behind. Investors can become too optimistic during a strong economy.</li>
<li><strong>Too much inflation:</strong> Inflation is the steady, upward trend in prices over time. Inflation isn’t a bad thing per se, but excessive inflation is a dangerous phenomenon. Central banks control inflation by raising interest rates, and higher interest rates depress economic activity.</li>
<li><strong>Too much deflation:</strong> While runaway inflation can create a recession, deflation can be even worse. Deflation is when prices decline over time, which causes wages to contract, which further depresses prices. When a deflationary feedback loop gets out of hand, people and business stop spending, which undermines the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Technological change:</strong> New inventions increase productivity and help the economy over the long term, but there can be short-term periods of adjustment to technological breakthroughs. In the 19th century, there were waves of labour-saving technological improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What’s the difference between <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/imf-flags-recession-risk/">Recession</a> and Depression?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recessions and depressions have similar causes, but the overall impact of a depression is much, much worse.</li>
<li>There are greater job losses, higher unemployment and steeper declines in GDP.</li>
<li>Most of all, a depression lasts longer—years, not months—and it takes more time for the economy to recover.</li>
<li>Economists do not have a set definition or fixed measurements to show what counts as a depression. Suffice to say, all the impacts of a depression are deeper and last longer.</li>
<li>In the past century, the US has faced just one depression: The Great Depression.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Great Depression</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Great Depression started in 1929 and lasted through 1933, although the economy didn’t really recover until World War II, nearly a decade later.</li>
<li>During the Great Depression, unemployment rose to 25% and the GDP fell by 30%.</li>
<li>It was the most unprecedented economic collapse in modern US history.</li>
<li>By way of comparison, the Great Recession was the worst recession since the Great Depression.</li>
<li>During the Great Recession, unemployment peaked around 10% and the recession officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, about a year and a half.</li>
<li>Some economists fear that the coronavirus recession could morph into a depression, depending how long it lasts.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How long do recessions last?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gulf War Recession (July 1990 to March 1991):</strong> At the start of the 1990s, the U.S. went through a short, eight-month recession, partly caused by spiking oil prices during the First Gulf War.</li>
<li><strong>The Great Recession (2008-2009):</strong> As mentioned, the Great Recession was caused in part by a bubble in the real estate market.</li>
<li><strong>Covid-19 Recession:</strong> The most recent recession began in February 2020 and lasted only two months, making it the shortest US recession in history.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can we predict a recession?</h4>
<p>Given that economic forecasting is uncertain, predicting future recessions is far from easy. However, the following warning signs can give you more time to figure out how to prepare for a recession before it happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An inverted yield curve:</strong> The yield curve is a graph that plots the market value—or the yield—of a range. When long-term yields are lower than short-term yields, it shows that investors are worried about a recession. This phenomenon is known as a yield curve inversion, and it has predicted past recessions.</li>
<li><strong>Declines in consumer confidence:</strong> Consumer spending is the main driver of the US economy. If surveys show a sustained drop in consumer confidence, it could be a sign of impending trouble for the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Drop in the Leading Economic Index (LEI):</strong> Published monthly by the Conference Board, the LEI strives to predict future economic trends. It looks at factors like applications for unemployment insurance, new orders for manufacturing and stock market performance.</li>
<li><strong>Sudden stock market declines:</strong> A large, sudden decline in stock markets could be a sign of a recession coming on, since investors sell off parts and sometimes all of their holdings in anticipation of an economic slowdown.</li>
<li><strong>Rising unemployment:</strong> It goes without saying that if people are losing their jobs, it’s a bad sign for the economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does a recession affect individuals?</h4>
<ul>
<li>We may lose your job during a recession, as unemployment levels rise. It becomes much harder to find a job replacement since more people are out of work.</li>
<li>People who keep their jobs may see cuts to pay and benefits, and struggle to negotiate future pay raises.</li>
<li>Investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets can lose money in a recession, reducing your savings and upsetting your plans for retirement.</li>
<li>Business owners make fewer sales during a recession, and may even be forced into bankruptcy.</li>
<li>With more people unable to pay their bills during a recession, lenders tighten standards for mortgages, car loans, and other types of financing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Preventive detentions in 2021 saw a rise by over 23.7% compared with the year before, with over 1.1 lakh people being placed under preventive detention, according to statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).</p>
<h4>What does NCRB report say on Preventive Detention?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Over 24,500 people placed under preventive detention were either in custody or still detained as of 2021-end — the highest since 2017 when the NCRB started recording this data.</li>
<li>Over 483 were detentions under the National Security Act, of which almost half (241) were either in custody or still detained as of 2021-end.</li>
<li>In 2017, the NCRB’s Crime in India report found that 67,084 persons had been detained as a preventive measure that year.</li>
<li>Of these, 48,815 were released between one and six months of their detention and 18,269 were either in custody or still in preventive detention as of the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Various provisions invoked for Preventive Detention</h4>
<ul>
<li>Among other laws under which the NCRB has recorded data on preventive detentions are the:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Goonda Act (State and Central) (29,306),</li>
<li>Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 (1,331), and</li>
<li>A category classified as “Other Detention Acts”, under which most of the detentions were registered (79,514).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Since 2017, the highest number of persons to be placed under preventive detention has consistently been under the “Other Detention Acts” category.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Concerns over the report</h4>
<ul>
<li>The number of persons placed under detention has been increasing since 2017 — to over 98,700 in 2018 and over 1.06 lakh in 2019 — before dipping to 89,405 in 2020 (due to lockdowns).</li>
<li>The number of persons placed under preventive detention has seen an increase in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is Preventive Detention?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Preventive detention means detaining a person so that to prevent that person from commenting on any possible crime.</li>
<li>In other words, preventive detention is an action taken by the administration on the grounds of the suspicion that some wrong actions may be done by the person concerned which will be prejudicial to the state.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preventive Detention in India</h4>
<p>A police officer can arrest an individual without orders from a Magistrate and without any warrant if he gets any information that such an individual can commit any offense.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preventive Detention Law, 1950:</strong> According to this law any person could be arrested and detained if his freedom would endanger the security of the country, foreign relations, public interests, or otherwise necessary for the country.</li>
<li><strong>Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) 1968:</strong> Within the ambit of UAPA law the Indian State could declare any organization illegal and could imprison anyone for interrogation if the said organization or person critiqued/questioned Indian sovereignty territorially.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the difference between Preventive Detention and an Arrest?</h4>
<ul>
<li>An ‘arrest’ is done when a person is charged with a crime.</li>
<li>In the case of preventive detention, a person is detained as he/she is simply restricted from doing something that might deteriorate the law-and-order situation.</li>
<li>Article 22 of the Indian Constitution provides protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rights of an Arrested Person in India</h4>
<p>A/c to Article 22(1) and 22(2) of the Indian constitution:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person cannot be arrested and detained without being informed why he is being arrested.</li>
<li>A person who is arrested cannot be denied to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. This means that the arrested person has right to hire a legal practitioner to defend himself/ herself.</li>
<li>Every person who has been arrested would be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours.</li>
<li>The custody of the detained person cannot be beyond the said period by the authority of magistrate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Exceptions for Preventive Detention</h4>
<p>Article 22(3) says that the above safeguards are not available to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the person is at the time being an enemy alien</li>
<li>If the person is arrested under certain law made for the purpose of “Preventive Detention”</li>
</ul>
<h4>Constitutional provision</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is extraordinary that the framers of the Indian Constitution, who suffered most because of the Preventive Detention Laws, did not hesitate to give Constitutional sanctity.</li>
<li>B.R. Ambedkar was of the opinion that the freedom of the individual should not supersede the interests of the state.</li>
<li>He had also stated that the independence of the country was in a state of inflancy and in order to save it, preventive detention was essential.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with preventive detention</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arbitrariness:</strong> The police determinations of whether a person poses a threat are not tested at a trial by leading evidence or examined by legally trained persons.</li>
<li><strong>Rights violation:</strong> Quiet often, there is no trial (upto 3 months), no periodic review, and no legal assistance for the detained person.</li>
<li><strong>Abuse:</strong> It does not provide any procedural protections such as to reduce detainees’ vulnerability to torture and discriminatory treatment, and to prevent officials’ misusing preventive detention for subversive activities.</li>
<li><strong>Tool for suppression:</strong> In the absence of proper safeguards, preventive detention has been misused, particularly against the Dalits and the minorities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What has the apex court recently rule?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Preventive detention is a <strong><u>necessary evil</u></strong> only to prevent public disorder, ruled the Supreme Court in 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>State should not arbitrarily resort to “preventive detention</u></strong>” to deal with <strong><u>all sundry “law and order” problems</u></strong>, which could be <strong><u>dealt with by the ordinary laws</u></strong> of the country.</li>
<li>Whenever an order under a preventive detention law is challenged, one of the questions the court must ask in deciding its legality is: <strong><u>was the ordinary law of the land sufficient</u></strong> to deal with the situation?</li>
<li>If the answer is in the affirmative, the detention order will be illegal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Upholding the Article 21</h4>
<ul>
<li>Preventive detention must fall within the four corners of Article 21 (due process of law) read with Article 22 (safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention) and the statute in question, Justice Nariman ruled.</li>
<li>The Liberty of a citizen is a most important right won by our forefathers after long, historical, and arduous struggles.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>Having such kind of acts has a restraining influence on the anti-social and subversive elements.</li>
<li>India is a large country and many separatist tendencies against the national security and integrity existed and existing and a strict law is required to counter the subversive activities.</li>
<li>The number of persons detained in these acts is not a very large and due attention is made before preventive detention.</li>
<li>The state should have very effective powers to deal with the acts in which the citizens involve in hostile activities, espionage, coercion, terrorism, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Doctor shortages are creating hurdles in health emergency response</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the crux of the article in simple words?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Medical qualification and expertise is necessary to deliver quality health services by medical professionals unlike by general health care workers who lack competency.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is public health?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Public health has been defined as “the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals”.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why there is need of qualification?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of training</strong>: Health workers have no training in public health; they are grassroots-level service providers. Asking them to be part of public health cadre trivialises the profession of public health.</li>
<li><strong>Separate profession</strong>: It is important to understand that public health is a separate profession with a specific set of competencies.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="public health" class="alignnone wp-image-631767" height="280" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/download-2.jpeg" width="339"/>What are 4 pillars of public health? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Academics: </strong>Academics refers to a good understanding of evidence generation and synthesis by having a good grounding in epidemiology and biostatistics. These competencies are also critical for monitoring and evaluating programmes, conducting surveillance, and interpreting data and routine reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Activism</strong>: Public health is inherently linked to ‘social change’ and an element of activism is core to public health. Public health requires social mobilisation at the grassroots level by understanding community needs, community organisation, etc. This requires grounding in social and behavioural sciences.</li>
<li><strong>Administration:</strong> Administration refers to administering health systems at different levels from a primary health centre to the district, State, and national level. This includes implementing and managing health programmes, addressing human resource issues, supply and logistical issues, etc. It includes microplanning of programme delivery, team building, leadership as well as financial management to some extent.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> In public health, there is little that one can do at an individual level; there must be communication with key stakeholders to change the status quo at different levels of government. This requires clear enunciation of the need, analysis of alternative set of actions and the cost of implementation or non-implementation. Good communication and negotiation skills are critical to perform this function. The related subjects are health policy, health economics, health advocacy and global health.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="public health" class="alignnone wp-image-631768" height="276" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/download-1-1.jpeg" width="415"/>What are the hurdles in absorbing others as public health professionals?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of skill</strong>: Many doctors and other health professionals work at the grassroots level and develop a good sense of public health due to their inclination. But they do not become public health professionals as they may not have the necessary skills. Nevertheless, they are valuable.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of critical expertise</strong>: Clinicians with training in epidemiology and biostatistics would not qualify to be public health professionals as they lack not only other essential and critical expertise but also an appropriate perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Compromise on quality</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/healthcare-in-india-is-ailing-here-is-how-to-fix-it/"><strong>Current challenges faced by public healthcare in India</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deficiency: </strong>The doctor-patient ratio of 1:1655 in India as against WHO norm of 1:1000 clearly shows the deficit of MBBS. While the government is working towards a solution and targeting to reach the required ratio, there is a need to relook at the overall medical education.</li>
<li><strong>Post pandemic scenario: </strong>The lag in formal medical education has come up evidently post-pandemic when the nation saw the medical fraternity struggling to fill the doctor deficit.</li>
<li><strong>Limited government seats:</strong> The number of seats available for medical education in India is far less than the number of aspirants who leave school with the dream of becoming doctors.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of skills:</strong> Though the institutes are managing to hire professors and lecturers, there is a lack of technical skills. Finding faculties in clinical and non-clinical disciplines is difficult and there are very few faculty development programs for upskilling the existing lot.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of infrastructure</strong>: The gap in digital learning infrastructure is currently the biggest challenge the sector is facing. There is an urgent need to adopt technology and have resources available to facilitate e-learning.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of research and innovation:</strong> The medical research and innovation needs an added push as there haven’t been many ground-breaking research here. The education system needs to focus more on increasing the quality of research. Additionally since industry academia partnership is not available, hence innovation also takes a back-seat.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>By establishing new medical colleges, the government can increase student intake as well as enhance equitable access to public health as separate profession. This will attract the best and the brightest people into this discipline, which is very important for the nation’s health. This is one lesson that we should learn from the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you understand by public health? Do you think it is a separate profession requiring a specific set of competencies? Examine.</strong></p></blockquote>
