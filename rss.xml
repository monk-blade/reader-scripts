<p>The Maoist movement is on the ebb on the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha boundary, with its cadre and militia strength heavily depleted.</p>
<h4><strong>Who are the Maoists?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Maoism is a form of <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/sansad-tv-perspective-left-wing-extremism/">communism</a> developed by Mao Zedong.</li>
<li>It is a doctrine to capture State power through a combination of armed insurgency, mass mobilization and strategic alliances.</li>
<li>The Maoists also use propaganda and disinformation against State institutions as other components of their insurgency doctrine.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Maoists and Maoism in India</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Communist Party of India (Maoist) is a Marxist–Leninist–Maoist banned communist political party and militant organization in India.</li>
<li>It aims to overthrow the “semi-colonial and semi-feudal Indian state” through people’s war.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Confused between Maoists and Naxalities?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Usually, people confuse themselves over Maoists and Naxalities and cannot exactly trace the difference between the two terminologies.</li>
<li>Media seems to be confused with the terms and uses Maoists and Naxalities quite inter-changeably.</li>
<li>This creates confusion in the readers’ minds over the actual meaning of individual terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The actual difference between the terms is as follows:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The difference between Maoists struggle and the Naxalite movement is that both trace their origin to the Naxalbari uprising of 1967.</li>
<li>But while the Naxalite movement thrives on the original spirit of Naxalbari; the Maoist struggle is an outcome of the 1967 uprising.</li>
<li>Maoists work with an agenda and use weapons to achieve their aims.</li>
<li>Naxalism focuses on mass organisations while the Maoism relies mainly on arms.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>History and evolution</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Russian Revolution:</strong> Naxalism in India, like any other leftist movement around the globe draws its ideological basis from the Russian revolution.</li>
<li><strong>Overthrowing Tsarist Regime:</strong> Lenin successfully fought against the Czarist Rule through a combination of peasant movement and an armed struggle.</li>
<li><strong>Marxian ideology of class struggle:</strong> The prime intent was to bestow power in the hands of the exploited and marginalized and enforce societal control over governance and nation building.</li>
<li><strong>Neo-Marxism:</strong> After the success of the Lenin-led revolution in Russia, the intellectual class in many countries got inspired. Prominent amongst them were Fidel Castro and Mao Zedong.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Root cause of origin in India</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate exploitation:</strong> Since Eastern India is rich in natural resources including forests, minerals and mines, tribal face exploitation and harassment from government and corporate bodies targeting to extract those resources.</li>
<li><strong>Tribal alienation:</strong> Tribal communities have been systematically alienated from their traditional rights over natural resources after independence.</li>
<li><strong>Livelihood losses:</strong> Tribal livelihood is at stake due to depletion of natural resource base.</li>
<li><strong>Forceful displacement:</strong> Forceful displacement from their homeland destroys their traditional governance system.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of governance: </strong>In such exploited areas, the absence of governance becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy since the delivery systems are extinguished through killings and intimidation.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign provocations:</strong> Many of LWE outfits are supported by external forces inimical to India and the Maoists consider such alliances as strategic assets.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Other factors:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Oppression and HR violations by Security Forces e.g. AFSPA</li>
<li>Violation of Constitutional Protections under PESA and FRA</li>
<li>Prevalence of Acute Poverty</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Impact of LWE</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Romanticism without a cause:</strong> Some sections of the society, especially the younger generation, have romantic illusions about the Maoists, arising out of an incomplete understanding of their ideology of Class –Struggle.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme violence:</strong> Their doctrine glorifies violence as the primary means to overwhelm the existing socio-economic and political structures.</li>
<li><strong>Destruction of governance mechanism:</strong> LWEs aims at creating a vacuum at the grassroots level of the existing governance structures by killing lower-level government officials, police personnel of the local police stations and the people’s representatives of the PRIs.</li>
<li><strong>Radicalization of youths:</strong> After creating a political and governance vacuum, they coerce the local population to join the movement.</li>
<li><strong>Urban-Maoism:</strong> Many extremists have facilitated mass-mobilization in semi-urban and urban areas through ostensibly democratic means often led by well-educated intellectuals.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Outcomes of perpetrating LWE</strong></h4>
<p>The Leftist organizations skilfully use state structures and legal processes to further the Maoist agenda and weaken the enforcement regime through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruitment of ‘professional revolutionaries’</li>
<li>Raising funds for the insurgency</li>
<li>Creating urban shelters for underground cadres</li>
<li>Providing legal assistance to arrested cadres and</li>
<li>Mass- mobilization by agitating over issues of relevance/ convenience</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Govt initiatives for LWE-affected areas</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aspirational Districts:</strong> The MHA has been tasked with the monitoring of the Aspirational districts programme in 35 LWE affected districts.</li>
<li><strong>HRD measures:</strong> Building of schools under the Eklavya model.</li>
<li><strong>Road Connectivity Project for LWE affected areas (RRP-II):</strong> This aims for improving road connectivity in LWE affected States. Under this, 9279 km of roads and 392 bridges are sanctioned.</li>
<li><strong>Naxal Surrender Policy:</strong> It aims to wean away misguided youth and hardcore naxalites who have strayed into the fold of the naxal movement and cannot find a way back.</li>
<li><strong>National Policy Action Plan</strong>: To address Left Wing Extremism approved in 2015, has development as one of the most important component.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SAMADHAN doctrine: </strong>It encompasses the entire strategy of government from short-term policy to long-term policy formulated at different levels. SAMADHAN stands for-</p>
<ul>
<li>S- Smart Leadership</li>
<li>A- Aggressive Strategy</li>
<li>M- Motivation and Training</li>
<li>A- Actionable Intelligence</li>
<li>D- Dashboard Based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and KRAs (Key Result Areas)</li>
<li>H- Harnessing Technology</li>
<li>A- Action plan for each Theatre</li>
<li>N- No access to Financing</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Indian counterinsurgency has to work with a dual objective of defeating the insurgents militarily and fully quell the insurgent impulses.</li>
<li>This will need institutional overhauls.</li>
<li>States must do more to synergize their efforts by launching coordinated operations, thereby denying Maoists any space for manoeuvrability.</li>
<li>On parallel grounds, it is also important to segregate the population from the insurgents both operationally and ideologically.</li>
<li>The conflict over the distribution of resources can be mended with economic development.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>As there is no official reassurance that India will not skip its decadal Census, we can declare that we have a case of the missing census.</li>
<li>The census is a very important source of statistics on various indicators.</li>
<li>The ability to hold a census peacefully, and not coercively, has been the hallmark of a civilized state and state of affairs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is a census?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Census is nothing but a process of collecting, compiling, analyzing, evaluating, publishing and disseminating statistical data regarding the population.</li>
<li>It covers demographic, social and economic data and is provided as of a particular date.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the purpose of the census?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>To collect the information for planning and formulation policies for Central and the State Governments.</li>
<li>The census tells us who we are and where we are going as a nation.</li>
<li>It helps the government decide how to distribute funds and assistance to states and localities.</li>
<li>The census data is widely used by National and International Agencies, scholars, business people, industrialists, and many more.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="census" class="alignnone wp-image-639440" height="263" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/136455-zzzrhagmjy-1581566412-300x158.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/136455-zzzrhagmjy-1581566412-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/136455-zzzrhagmjy-1581566412.jpg 600w" width="499"/>Why is the census important?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provides most credible source of information</strong><strong>:</strong> information on Demography (Population characteristics), Economic Activity, Literacy and Education, Housing &amp; Household Amenities, Urbanisation, Fertility and Mortality, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Language, Religion, Migration, Disability and many other socio-cultural and demographic data<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://eci.gov.in/delimitation-website/delimitation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>The delimitation/reservation of Constituencies</strong><strong>: </strong></a>Parliamentary/Assembly/Panchayats and other Local Bodies are also done on the basis of the demographic data thrown up by the Census.</li>
<li><strong>Administration: </strong>Census is the basis for reviewing the country’s progress in the past decade, monitoring the ongoing Schemes of the Government.</li>
<li><strong>Planning the future:</strong> It provides pathways for planning and resolving problems, and fixing deficiencies. Government goes through analysis over the census data and formulates policies for the future accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed accounts: </strong>The best of sample surveys find it impossible to beat a census as It carries the promise of counting each and every Indian. A census is when the state connects to every individual and it will find it hard to hide or duck from the data.</li>
<li><strong>Welfare schemes</strong>: Identifying the actual beneficiaries<strong>, </strong>Census is the key to creating identity and affirming it over time .Census data enable neat, inter-temporal comparability.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Censuses in India so far</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Census operations started in India long back during the period of the Maurya dynasty.</li>
<li>It was systematized during the years 1865 to 1872, though it has been conducted uninterruptedly from the year 1881 being a trustworthy resource of information.</li>
<li>India has held its decadal censuses regularly from 1881 to 2011, despite diseases, world wars, Partition and other instances of turmoil only COVID-19 as an exception.</li>
<li>Census 2011 is the 15th National Census of the Country.</li>
<li>The Census established that the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is coming down at a very rapid pace and is well on its way to stabilization.</li>
<li>The 2011 Census also dispelled the notion of divorce rate differentials between city and rural India. The urban divorce rate (0.89%) is almost equal to the rural rate (0.82%).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="census" class="alignnone wp-image-639441" height="334" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Census-exercise_featured-image-300x167.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Census-exercise_featured-image-300x167.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Census-exercise_featured-image-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Census-exercise_featured-image-768x429.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Census-exercise_featured-image-1200x670.jpg 1200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Census-exercise_featured-image.jpg 1390w" width="600"/>Why census 2021 has been postponed indefinitely?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Ministry of Home Affairs told the Lok Sabha in August, 2021 that the massive, decennial exercise came to a grinding halt due to the advent of Coid-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What was the original timeline of the Census and how is it being delayed?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gazette notification: </strong>The Centre’s intent to conduct Census 2021 was notified in the Gazette of India on March 28, 2019. The exercise was to have been conducted in two phases, with the housing Census from April to September 2020 and population enumeration from February 9, 2021.but it did not take place due to the spread of COVID-19.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative timeline post-covid-19: </strong>In March 2021, the Home Ministry gave a Parliamentary panel a tentative alternative timeline. The fieldwork for the first phase, which would provide data on housing conditions, household amenities and assets possessed by households, is expected during 2021-22, while the fieldwork to count the population and provide data on demography, religion, Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC/ST), language, literacy and education, economic activity, migration and fertility would be done in 2023-24, it said.</li>
<li><strong>Said Provisional data: </strong>The Ministry added that provisional data would be released in 2023-24 before the next general elections. Usually, more detailed tables providing village-level data on specific indicators will continue to be released for several years after the key information.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="census" class="alignnone wp-image-639443" height="266" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/population-census-2021-300x158.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/population-census-2021-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/population-census-2021-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/population-census-2021-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/population-census-2021.jpg 1200w" width="505"/>Impact of delay in census 2021</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public distribution system</strong>:</li>
<li>The National Food Security Act, 2013, says that 75% of the rural population and 50% of the rural population are entitled to receive subsidised food grains from the government under the targeted public distribution system (PDS).</li>
<li>Under the 2011 Census, India’s population was about 121 crore, hence PDS covered approximately 80 crore people.</li>
<li>If we apply projected population of 137crore ,current delay in Census data would continue to deprive more than 10 crore people of subsidised food entitlements, with the biggest gaps in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with 2.8 crore and 1.8 crore projected exclusions respectively.</li>
<li><strong>welfare schemes:</strong></li>
<li>Although the Government’s intent to use SECC data but failed at budgetary allocation for the projected expansion<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Census data may not be used to calculate the beneficiaries of most schemes, but it is critical to policy planning, budgeting and administration<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>A number of schemes need to use the disaggregated age and fertility indicators to assess effectiveness as demographics change over time.</li>
<li><strong>Huge lag in Migration data: </strong></li>
<li>From the COVID19 lockdowns it is realized that the Numbers, causes and patterns of migration, which could not be answered using outdated 2011 Census data.</li>
<li>The D-tables on migration from the 2011 Census were only released in 2019, so it’s outdated by the time it came out.</li>
<li>Apart from the One Nation, One Ration card scheme which now allows for portability of food subsidy entitlements, the migration data is actually not used too much in broader economic policy and planning.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/the-caste-census-debate/"><strong>Why there is a demand for caste census in India?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s population has since increased three-fold to 1.21 billion in 2011.</li>
<li>Experts believe the economic status of the dominant OBC castes have improved in the past 80 years and certain castes have not benefited as much.</li>
<li>So, the new caste census is required to measure the economic and social well-being of all castes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Despite several observations made by the Supreme Court of India (SC) against the inefficient functioning of the CBI nothing has happened to improve the situation.</li>
<li>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is in the news now and often.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Bureau of Investigation traces its origins to the <strong>Delhi Special Police Establishment</strong>, a Central Government Police force, which was <strong>set up in 1941</strong> by the Government of India.</li>
<li>It then aimed to <strong>investigate bribery and corruption</strong> in transactions with the <u>War and Supply Department of India.</u></li>
<li>It then had its headquarters in Lahore.</li>
<li>After the end of the war, there was a continued need for a central governmental agency to investigate bribery and corruption by central-government employees.</li>
<li>The DSPE acquired its popular current name, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), through a Home Ministry resolution dated in 1963.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Mandate of the CBI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The CBI is the <strong>main investigating agency</strong> of the GoI.</li>
<li>It is <strong>not a statutory body</strong>; it derives its powers from the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.</li>
<li>Its important role is to prevent corruption and maintain integrity in administration.</li>
<li>It works under the <strong>supervision of the CVC</strong> (Central Vigilance Commission) in matters pertaining to the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.</li>
<li>The CBI is also India’s <strong>official representative with the</strong> <strong>INTERPOL</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="CBI" class="alignnone wp-image-639469" height="367" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/government-axes-tenure-of-two-senior-cbi-officers-anish-prasad-abhay-singh-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/government-axes-tenure-of-two-senior-cbi-officers-anish-prasad-abhay-singh-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/government-axes-tenure-of-two-senior-cbi-officers-anish-prasad-abhay-singh-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/government-axes-tenure-of-two-senior-cbi-officers-anish-prasad-abhay-singh-768x576.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/government-axes-tenure-of-two-senior-cbi-officers-anish-prasad-abhay-singh.jpg 1200w" width="489"/>Cases to investigate</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Cases connected to infringement of <strong>economic and fiscal laws</strong></li>
<li>Crimes of a serious nature that have <strong>national and international ramifications</strong></li>
<li><strong>Coordination with</strong> the activities of the various state police forces and anti-corruption agencies.</li>
<li>It can also take up any <strong>case of public importance</strong> and investigate it</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining crime statistics</strong> and disseminating criminal information.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Notable cases cracked by CBI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bhanwri Devi missing case:</strong> Jat leader and former Rajasthan minister Mahipal Maderna, Congress MLA Malkhan Singh and Bhanwari’s husband Amarchand were all part of the conspiracy to abduct and eliminate Bhanwari. Bhanwari had threatened to expose Malkhan’s relationship with her at the Bishnoi mahapanchayat.  Maderna, Malkhan, the three kidnappers and Sahiram along with Amarchand were arrested by the CBI.</li>
<li><strong>Noida double murder case:</strong> In May 2008, the nation was shocked with the sensational double murders in Noida. The victims were Arushi Talwar and Hemraj Banjade. Initially, there was no clarity about the motive or the perpetrator of this ghastly crime. After a lengthy investigation which spanned close to 6 years, the CBI based on circumstantial evidence established that the parents of Aarushi Talwar, Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar were the perpetrators of this crime.</li>
<li><strong>The Satyam Case: </strong> B Ramalinga Raju, the disgraced chairman of Satyam Computers Services Ltd, along with 13 individuals and entities including Chintalapati Srinivasa Raju of iLabs, made Rs 2,000 crore in illegal wealth in the Satyam scam. The CBI constituted a Multi-Disciplinary Investigation Team (MDIT) to investigate the case. The team worked hard, burnt midnight oil and achieved success in a record time of 45 days when it filed its first chargesheet against the accused for offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and falsification of accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Issues with CBI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caged parrot:</strong> The Supreme Court has criticized the CBI by calling it a “caged parrot speaking in its master’s voice”.</li>
<li><strong>Political interference:</strong> It has often been used by the government of the day to cover up wrongdoing, keep coalition allies in line and political opponents at bay.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation delay:</strong> It has been accused of enormous delays in concluding investigations due to political inertia.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Credibility:</strong> CBI has been criticised for its mismanagement of several cases involving prominent politicians and mishandling of several sensitive cases like Bofors scandal, Bhopal gas tragedy.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Accountability:</strong> CBI is exempted from the provisions of the Right to Information Act, thus, lacking public accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Acute shortage of personnel:</strong> A major cause of the shortfall is the government’s sheer mismanagement of CBI’s workforce.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-general-consent-for-cbi/"><strong>Limited Powers:</strong></a> The powers and jurisdiction of members of the CBI for investigation are subject to the consent of the State Govt., thus limiting the extent of investigation by CBI.</li>
<li><strong>Restricted Access:</strong> Prior approval of Central Government to conduct inquiry or investigation on the employees of the Central Government is a big obstacle in combating corruption at higher levels of bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why was it called caged carrot by the Supreme Court?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Politicisation of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been a work in progress for years.</li>
<li>Corruption and Politically biased nature, This was highlighted in Supreme Court criticism for being a caged parrot speaking in its master’s voice.</li>
<li>CBI has been accused of becoming ‘handmaiden’ to the party in power; as a result high profile cases are not treated seriously.</li>
<li>Since CBI is run by central police officials on deputation hence chances of getting influenced by government was visible in the hope of better future postings.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Suggestions for the improvement of the functioning of the CBI under the supervision of the <a href="https://cvc.gov.in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVC</a></strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>One, the CVC Act should be amended, providing for a five/seven member Central Vigilance Commission, which could broadly assume the role visualised for the Lokpal. The selection process of the CVC members should be more broad based to prevent favouritism or from controversial persons being appointed.</li>
<li>Two, the CVC should constitute an advisory committee of at least 11 members drawn from criminologists and forensic science experts. This will augment the professional input in its functioning. Further, to reduce the burden on the CVC, it should be given the power to go to any expert or professional to assist it in screening complaints.</li>
<li>Three, the jurisdiction of CVC, which presently covers all employees of the central government and the CPSUs, should remain unchanged. There is already an administrative arrangement to delegate the vigilance administration over class II and lower formations to the ministries/departments concerned. However, if the lower formations are involved with the class I officers in a composite case, the CVC exercises a natural jurisdiction over all of them. To make this arrangement more effective, it would be important that the CVC exercises complete control over the selection, appointment and functioning of the CVOs.</li>
<li>Four, the CVC should have an adequately experienced team to technically examine and assess the gravity of a complaint, which can then be assigned to the CBI for investigation or can be investigated by this team. After assessing a complaint by this broad-based CVC, there should be no need to seek prior permission from the government.</li>
<li>Five, in the cases assigned to it by the CVC, the CBI should be made functionally and financially independent of the controls of any government ministry/department. The professional supervision over the investigations of the CBI should rest only with the CVC.</li>
<li>Six, the manner of the appointment of the CBI Director should be broad based as in the case of the CVC members, whereas the other inductions/appointments in the CBI should be brought under the overarching supervision of the CVC.</li>
<li>Seven, to achieve better synergy between anti-corruption laws and grievance handling, the laws relating to the whistle blowers and grievance redressal should be placed within the jurisdiction of the CVC.</li>
<li>Eight, effective administration of anti-corruption laws at the grass roots is the key to responsible governance. The state and their anti-corruption agencies would, therefore, need to be equally insulated from the state government’s interference on similar lines.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Reforming CBI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need for autonomy:</strong>   As long as the government of the day has the power to transfer and post officials of its choice in the CBI, the investigating agency will not enjoy autonomy and will be unable to investigate cases freely.</li>
<li><strong>Selection of director/ Officers:</strong> To ensure that the CBI is a robust, independent and credible investigation agency, there is an urgent need to work out a much more transparent mechanism for selection and induction of officers on deputation.</li>
<li><strong>Lokpal scrutiny:</strong> The Lokpal Act already calls for a three-member committee made up of the PM, the leader of the opposition and the CJI to select the director.</li>
<li><strong>Bifurcation of Cadre:</strong> CBI should be bifurcated into an Anti-Corruption Body and a National Crime Bureau.</li>
<li><strong>Develop own cadre</strong>: One of the demands that have been before Supreme Court, and in line with international best practices, is for the CBI to develop its own dedicated cadre of officers.</li>
<li><strong>Annual social audit</strong> should be carried out by ten reputed, knowledgeable persons with background of law, justice, public affairs and administration and the audit report should be placed before the parliament.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>About Enforcement Directorate (ED)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It goes back to May 1, 1956, when an ‘<strong><u>Enforcement Unit</u>’</strong> was formed in the Department of Economic Affairs.</li>
<li>It then aimed for handling Exchange Control Laws violations under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA).</li>
<li>The ED today is a <strong><u>multi-dimensional organisation</u></strong> investigating economic offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, Foreign Exchange Management Act and FERA.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="CBI" class="alignnone wp-image-639470" height="273" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Enforcement-Directorate-Powers-and-Functions-of-ED-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Enforcement-Directorate-Powers-and-Functions-of-ED-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Enforcement-Directorate-Powers-and-Functions-of-ED-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Enforcement-Directorate-Powers-and-Functions-of-ED-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Enforcement-Directorate-Powers-and-Functions-of-ED.jpg 1200w" width="485"/>From where does the ED get its powers?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>When proceeds of crime (property/money) are generated, the best way to save that money is by parking it somewhere, so one is not answerable to anyone in the country.</li>
<li>Therefore, there was a need to control and prevent the laundering of money.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>PMLA</u></strong> was brought in for this exact reason in 2002, but was enacted only in 2005.</li>
<li>The objective was to prevent parking of the money outside India and to trace out the layering and the trail of money.</li>
<li>So as per the Act, the ED got its power to investigate under Sections 48 (authorities under act) and 49 (appointment and powers of authorities and other officers).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>At what stage does the ED step in when a crime is committed?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Whenever any offence is registered by a local police station, which has generated proceeds of crime <strong><u>over and above ₹1 crore</u></strong>, the investigating police officer forwards the details to the ED.</li>
<li>Alternately, <strong><u>if the offence comes under the knowledge of the Central agency</u></strong>, they can then call for the First Information Report (FIR) or the chargesheet if it has been filed directly by police officials.</li>
<li>This will be done to find out if any laundering has taken place.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="CBI" class="alignnone wp-image-639474" height="380" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aryan-khan-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aryan-khan-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aryan-khan-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aryan-khan-768x576.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aryan-khan.jpg 1200w" width="507"/>What differentiates the probe between the local police and officers of the ED?</strong></h4>
<p>Case study:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a theft has been committed in a nationalised bank, the local police station will first investigate the crime.</li>
<li>If it is learnt that the founder of the bank took all the money and kept it in his house, without being spent or used, then the crime is only theft and the ED won’t interfere because the amount has already been seized.</li>
<li>But if the amount which has been stolen is used after four years to purchase some properties, then the ill-gotten money is brought back in the market.</li>
<li>Or if the money is given to someone else to buy properties in different parts of the country, then there is ‘laundering’ of money.</li>
<li>Hence the ED will need to step in and look into the layering and attachment of properties to recover the money.</li>
<li>If jewellery costing ₹1 crore is stolen, police officers will investigate the theft. The ED, however, will attach assets of the accused to recover the amount of ₹1 crore.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="CBI" class="alignnone wp-image-639473" height="273" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ezgif-sixteen_nine_157-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ezgif-sixteen_nine_157-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ezgif-sixteen_nine_157-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ezgif-sixteen_nine_157.jpg 948w" width="485"/>What are the other roles and functions of the ED?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ED carries out <strong><u>search (property) and seizure (money/documents)</u></strong> after it has decided that the money has been laundered, under Section 16 (power of survey) and Section 17 (search and seizure) of the PMLA.</li>
<li>On the basis of that, the <strong><u>authorities will decide if arrest is needed</u></strong> as per Section 19 (power of arrest).</li>
<li>Under Section 50, the ED can also <strong><u>directly carry out search and seizure without calling the person for questioning</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It is <strong><u>not necessary to summon the person first </u></strong>and then start with the search and seizure.</li>
<li><strong><u>If the person is arrested, the ED gets 60 days to file the prosecution</u></strong> <strong><u>complaint</u></strong> (chargesheet) as the punishment under PMLA doesn’t go beyond seven years.</li>
<li>If no one is arrested and only the <strong><u>property is attached</u></strong>, then the prosecution complaint along with attachment order is to be submitted before the adjudicating authority within 60 days.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Can the ED investigate cases of money laundering retrospectively?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>If an ill-gotten property is acquired before the year 2005 (when the law was brought in) and disposed off, then there is no case under PMLA.</li>
<li>But if proceeds of the crime were possessed before 2005, kept in storage, and used after 2005 by buying properties, the <strong><u>colour of the money is still black and the person is liable to be prosecuted under PMLA.</u></strong></li>
<li>Under Section 3 of PMLA, a person shall be guilty of money-laundering, if such person is found to have directly or indirectly attempted to indulge or knowingly assist a party involved in one or more of the following activities:</li>
<li>Concealment; possession; acquisition; use; or projecting as untainted property; or claiming as untainted property in any manner etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Allegations against ED</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Huge discretions:</strong> The ED is the only Central agency in the country that does not require permission from the government to summon or prosecute politicians or government functionaries for committing economic offences like money laundering.</li>
<li><strong>Used for petty crimes:</strong> PMLA is pulled into the investigation of even “ordinary” crimes and assets of genuine victims have been attached.</li>
<li><strong>Actual purpose denigrated: </strong>PMLA was a comprehensive penal statute to counter the threat of money laundering, specifically stemming from the trade in narcotics.</li>
<li><strong>Violations of Rights:</strong> PMLA was enacted in response to India’s global commitment to combat the menace of money laundering. Instead, rights have been “cribbed, cabined and confined”.</li>
<li><strong>Functional opacity:</strong> There is also a lack of clarity about ED’s selection of cases to investigate. We often see ED raiding houses of opposition parties suddenly.</li>
<li><strong>Poor rate of conviction:</strong> We have hardly read the conclusion of cases by ED. Meantime media-trial tears off the accused person’s credibility which is the most desired intent.</li>
<li><strong>Under-trials and slower prosecution</strong>: ED has been focusing on keeping the accused in custody rather than actually proving the charges against them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Challenges to ED</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>ED being dragged to court:</strong> The petitions against the ED had the effect of slowing down the investigations, as officers have to defend themselves in court.</li>
<li><strong>Foul crying politicians:</strong> There are attempts to cover up unexplained, high-value transactions that fall within the PMLA’s ambit</li>
<li><strong>Investigation of foreign transactions:</strong> Getting information on accounts and money stashed abroad to establish a trail is the biggest challenge they face.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The fight against corruption is intimately linked with the reform of the investigations.</li>
<li>Therefore the adjudicating authorities must work in cooperation and ensure the highest standards of transparency and fairness.</li>
<li>ED has been walking a tightrope to safeguard its integrity by speeding up investigations and court procedures.</li>
<li>The need of the hour could be systemic fixes—and not shrill calls to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</li>
<li>It is unlikely that corruption can be substantially reduced without modifying the way government agencies operate.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is for the nation to demand that the country’s premier investigating agencies like the CBI, income tax authorities and the ED are not used as instruments of blackmail and intimidation by the government of the day. Rather they should work with complete objectivity and in the interest of the nation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Internal debates: </strong>During intra party elections there would be contests between leaders. There will be debate, discussions some criticism, and differences of opinion. There should be a dialogue between the leaders, members and volunteers</li>
<li><strong>Democratic culture: </strong>Political parties don’t have to be homogeneous in terms of both ideas and leadership. Political parties are aggregations of interests yet Party workers should not feel they are being ignored, that their efforts are not appreciated or not going in vain under the shadow of a leader came from the family lines.</li>
<li><strong>Political career: </strong>Having these internal elections, meetings and contests of ideas is important.  Internal election is a key for upward mobility. It gives better understanding of the party’s idea, culture and the work process.</li>
<li><strong>High command culture: </strong>High command culture is what we are witnessing today in India and South Asia is problematic for democracy, where all political parties are centralized. The few members at the helm are controlling even the smallest decisions about what party should do. Members are not able to express freely their personal views.</li>
<li><strong>Feudalism: </strong>They are family-controlled parties, and dynastic politics has become a norm. Won’t be able to name more than three or four political parties which have survived 30 years in Indian politics and are today not controlled by apolitical family.</li>
<li><strong>Favoritism: </strong>where you can only rise up the ranks in the system depending on the relationship you share with the first family of that party. Irrespective of difference of opinions with the top leaders of the party, the upward mobility majorly depends on the relationship.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no law for intra-party elections as of now.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seshan effect: </strong>When T.N. Seshan was at the helm of the Election Commission of India (ECI); by an executive order political parties were ordered to conduct intra party elections. And because Seshan was a much respected and feared person, political parties complied with it. Since then, elections are held periodically in every recognized party.</li>
<li><strong>What Constitution says</strong>: Article 324 says free and fair elections to parliament, state assemblies, president and vice-president. It doesn’t say anything about political party or election within.</li>
<li><strong>What Courts argue: </strong>The courts have made an observation that nothing in Article 324 of the Constitution, or Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 tells us that the ECI can actually regulate internal structures, organizations or elections of the party. Which is why parties, on the left or right, have not been conducting internal elections as we want them to conduct them</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Worldwide practice</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>USA: </strong>In the U.S. election, the selection of the candidate to be the presidential nominee is done via debate, in which the contenders condemn and criticize each other<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>UK: </strong>In the U.K. Democracy should be at every level, and political parties are an essential pillar of democracy. Intra party election happens to choose the leader of party.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is state funding of election?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is an idea where state or Government of India provides funding to political parties according to their electoral performance.</li>
<li>As of today, state does provide land at concessional rate, free air time on national television but today political parties do not come under RTI. Hence some suggest state funding of elections to regulate the behavior of political parties.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the Role of <a href="https://eci.gov.in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Election Commission</a> in organizational election of political parties?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ECI does insist on organizational elections, but only gently. They do go through the process.</li>
<li>Election can happen only if there are two or more candidates in the fray. Getting elected unopposed is also a valid election. It is not just within the political parties, we have</li>
</ul>
<p>Seen it in panchayat elections and sometimes even in Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections that candidates have got elected unopposed.</p>
<h4><strong><img alt="Intra party election" class="alignnone wp-image-639485" height="376" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BJPcampaign1-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BJPcampaign1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BJPcampaign1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BJPcampaign1.jpg 1000w" width="564"/>How to fix the accountability of the political parties?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>ECI re-interpreting the existing laws, as happened in the 1990s<strong>. </strong>ECI has to imagine its role as a regulator of these political parties and in some ways. They have to try out milder options.</li>
<li>Political parties are required to hold organizational elections regularly. The parties are required to inform the ECI about changes in their office-bearers.</li>
<li>They are required to submit a document of expenditure incurred during elections and in the non-election periods. But there is no cost attached to non-compliance.</li>
<li>Expert suggests state funding of election would ensure the accountability of parties as it will bring parties under ambit of RTI and voters can seek the expenditure report from parties. Election commission can also penalize party for non-compliance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Election for a gram panchayat or presidential it is always a booster for democracy. Intraparty elections are beneficial for party, contesting individual and country at large, it culminates into emergence of quality leadership which in turn a boon for good governance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains Question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Intra party elections are essential feature of healthy democracy. Discuss the role of election commission, the courts and the political parties for the healthy functioning of intra party democracy.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The Central government has announced a special tourist circuit encompassing five key sites associated with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.</p>
<h4><strong>Why in news?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Activists have urged that Mahad, located in Raigad District of Maharashtra, famous for Mahad Lake Satyagraha should also be included in the proposed circuit.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Ambedkar Circuit</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The five cities in the tourist circuit as announced are Mhow (his birthplace), London (where he resided and studied), Nagpur (also studied here), Delhi (where he passed away) and finally Mumbai (where he was cremated).</li>
<li>With a special AC train, the government is looking to trace the footsteps of Ambedkar in India by giving better connectivity to four of these spots.</li>
<li>The idea is to attract tourists beyond the Dalit community, who mostly visit these places as a pilgrimage.</li>
<li>The journey will include meals, ground transportation, and entry to the sites.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>About the sites</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Janma Bhoomi</strong>– Ambedkar’s birthplace in Madhya Pradesh’s Mhow</li>
<li><strong>Shiksha Bhoomi</strong>– the place in London where he stayed while studying in the UK</li>
<li><strong>Deeksha Bhoomi</strong>– the place in Nagpur where he embraced Buddhism</li>
<li><strong>Mahaparinirvan Bhoomi-</strong> the place of his demise in Delhi and</li>
<li><strong>Chaitya Bhoomi-</strong> the place of his cremation in Mumbai</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h4><strong>Back2Basics: Tourism Circuits</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The government had identified 15 tourist circuits under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme in 2014-15.</li>
<li>Besides the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/pib-ramayana-circuit/">Ramayana</a> and Buddhist Circuits, others include Coastal Circuit, Desert Circuit, Eco Circuit, Heritage, North East, Himalayan, Sufi, Krishna, Rural, Tribal, and Tirthankar Circuits.</li>
<li>In terms of train collaboration, the Ramayana, Buddhist, and North East Circuits are already active, while Ambedkar will be fourth.</li>

<p>The International Argo Program system to observe carbon concentration in the world’s oceans is extremely inadequate to meet the growing and urgent need for information on oceanic carbon, says a report.</p>
<h4>What is Argo?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Argo is an international program that uses profiling floats to observe temperature, salinity, currents, and, recently, bio-optical properties in the Earth’s oceans; it has been operational since the early 2000s.</li>
<li>The real-time data it provides is used in climate and oceanographic research.</li>
<li>A special research interest is to quantify the ocean heat content (OHC).</li>
<li>Each instrument (float) spends almost all its life below the surface.</li>
<li>The name Argo was chosen because the array of floats works in partnership with the Jason earth observing satellites that measure the shape of the ocean surface.</li>
<li>In Greek mythology Jason sailed on his ship the Argo in search of the Golden Fleece.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are its aims?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The data that Argo collects describes the temperature and salinity of the water and some of the floats measure other properties that describe the biology/chemistry of the ocean.</li>
<li>The main reason for collecting these data is to help us understand the oceans’ role in earth’s climate.</li>
<li>For example, the changes in sea level (once the tides are averaged out) depend partly on the melting of icecaps and partly on the amount of heat stored in the oceans.</li>
<li>Argo’s temperature measurements allow us to calculate how much heat is stored and to monitor from year to year how the distribution of heat changes with depth and from area to area.</li>
<li>As ocean heat content increases, sea level rises, just like the mercury in a thermometer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each Argo float (costing between $20,000 and $150,000 depending on the individual float’s technical specification) is launched from a ship.</li>
<li>The float’s weight is carefully adjusted so that, as it sinks, it eventually stabilizes at a pre-set level, usually 1 km.</li>
<li>Ten days later, an internal battery-driven pump transfers oil between a reservoir inside the float and an external bladder.</li>
<li>This makes the float first descend to 2km and then return to the surface measuring ocean properties as it rises.</li>
<li>The data and the float position are relayed to satellites and then on to receiving stations on shore.</li>
<li>The float then sinks again to repeat the 10 day cycle until its batteries are exhausted.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>G4, Coffee Club, UNSC</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>UNSC reforms</p></div></div><p><img alt="g4" class="alignnone wp-image-639722 size-full" height="546" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/unsc-1.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/unsc-1.jpg 901w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/unsc-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/unsc-1-768x465.jpg 768w" width="901"/></p>
<p>The G4 nations have said that the Intergovernmental Negotiations on <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/explained-india-at-united-nations-security-council/">UN Security Council</a> reform are constrained by a lack of openness and transparency.</p>
<h4><strong>Who are the G4 Countries?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The G4 nations, comprising <strong><u>Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan</u></strong> are four countries which support each other’s bids for permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.</li>
<li>Their primary aim is the permanent member seats on the Security Council.</li>
<li>Each of these four countries have figured among the elected non-permanent members of the council since the UN’s establishment.</li>
<li>Their economic and political influence has grown significantly in the last decades, reaching a scope comparable to the permanent members (P5).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Deterrent in their cause</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The UK and France have backed the G4’s bid for permanent seats.</li>
<li>All the permanent members of P5 have supported India’s bids for permanent seat.</li>
<li>However, China has previously implied that it is only ready to support India if it does not associate its bid with Japan.</li>
<li>The US has sent strong indications to Brazil that it is willing to support its membership; albeit, without a veto.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What holds them back?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There has been discontent among the present permanent members regarding the inclusion of controversial nations or countries not supported by them.</li>
<li>For instance, Japan’s bid is heavily opposed by China, North Korea, Russia and South Korea who think that <strong><u>Japan</u></strong> needs to make sincere reparations for <strong><u>war crimes</u></strong> committed during World War II.</li>
<li>Under the leadership of Italy, countries that strongly oppose the G4 countries’ bids have formed the <strong><u>Uniting for Consensus movement</u></strong>, also called as <strong><u>Coffee Club</u></strong>.</li>
<li>In Asia, Pakistan opposes India’s bid.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why India deserves a permanent seat?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India has been part of UN since inception.</li>
<li>It has the world’s second-largest population and is the world’s largest democracy suited to represent South Asia.</li>
<li>It has contributed maximum peacekeepers to UN so far.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why reform UNSC?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-representative nature:</strong> UNSC in current form is not representative of developing world and global needs, with primacy of policy being political tool in hands of P5, is well recognised globally.</li>
<li><strong>Contention over Veto and Technical Holds:</strong> <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/china-blocks-terrorist-listing-at-unsc-1267-list/">Veto power</a> with P5 enables any one of them to prevent the adoption of any “substantive” draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support.</li>
<li><strong>Divided institution: </strong>UNSC has become an organisation, which can pass strong resolutions against weak countries, weak resolutions against strong countries and no resolution against P5 countries.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There is a possibility that if UN doesn’t reform itself, it may lose relevance and alternate global and regional groupings may assume greater importance.</li>
<li>More global pressure from middle powers like G4 may force an expansion of UNSC as a possibility, but abolition of veto power in current set up is unlikely</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: United Nations Security Council (UNSC)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The UNSC is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations and is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security.</li>
<li>Its powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, the establishment of international sanctions, and the authorization of military action through Security Council resolutions.</li>
<li>It is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states.</li>
<li>The Security Council consists of fifteen members. Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the United States—serve as the body’s five permanent members.</li>
<li>These permanent members can veto any substantive Security Council resolution, including those on the admission of new member states or candidates for Secretary-General.</li>
<li>The Security Council also has 10 non-permanent members, elected on a regional basis to serve two-year terms. The body’s presidency rotates monthly among its members.</li>

<li>Infrastructure diplomacy is to promote infrastructure cooperation and economic ties overseas through political means and to enhance political trust between countries via collaboration in infrastructure development.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why in news? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>“Several foreign governments are now approaching us to work in their geographies and help build their infrastructure. Therefore, in 2022, we also laid the foundation to seek a broader expansion beyond India’s boundaries,” chairman and founder of the Adani group Gautam Adani,<strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/gautam-adani-second-most-richest-billionaire-forbes-list-bernard-arnault-jeff-bezos-elon-musk-8154481/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now the world’s third-richest person</a>.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Foreign presence much earlier</strong>: In fact, the Adani group had been scouting abroad much earlier. Since 2010, the Adani group has been in Australia, developing the Carmichael coal mine in Queensland.</li>
<li><strong>A greenfield multi-purpose port:</strong> In 2017, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zones (Ltd) signed an MoU for a greenfield multi-purpose port for handling containers at Carey Island in Selangor state, about 50 km southwest of Kuala Lumpur.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is situation now?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company pursue international infrastructure projects aggressively</strong>: The last two years, however, have seen the company pursue international infrastructure projects aggressively. In May 2022, APSEZ made a winning bid of $1.18 billion for Israeli state-owned Haifa Port, jointly with Israeli chemicals and logistics firm Gadot.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic joint investments</strong>: In August this year, APSEZ and Abu Dhabi’s AD Ports Group signed MoU for “strategic joint investments” in Tanzania. The new ASEZ-AD MoU will look at a bouquet of infrastructure projects besides Bagamoyo in the East African Indian Ocean nation — rail, maritime services, digital services and industrial zones<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>India’s strategic objectives than has been possible so far</strong>: Is it just a coincidence that Adani’s global expansion closely shadows the Chinese footprint along its Belt and Road Initiative? Or is it that as <a href="https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delhi</a>competes with China for influence in the neighbourhood and beyond, the Adani group’s size, resources and capacity are seen as a key element in achieving India’s strategic objectives than has been possible so far.</li>
<li><strong>India’s infrastructure diplomacy</strong>: Is now becoming identified the world over with one company.</li>
<li><strong>Public and private investment to bridge gaps</strong>: For the Adani group, described as India’s biggest ports and logistics company, there couldn’t be a better time. As the Quad grouping of Australia, India, Japan, and the US, competes with China in the Indo-Pacific, it has committed “to catalyse infrastructure delivery” by putting more than $50 billion on the table for “assistance and investment” in the Indo-Pacific over the next five years and “drive public and private investment to bridge gaps”.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Win-Win deal</strong>: Adani’s new “no-hands” model of doing business with neighbours a power plant in Jharkhand, exporting all its output to Bangladesh has been seen as a “win-win” deal.</li>
<li><strong>Economic interests lie at the heart of geopolitics:</strong> The link between diplomacy and commercial interests has generated its share of debate, especially in the US, where its diplomats, intelligence agencies and military interventions abroad have actively pushed the interests of big business first the hunt for cheaper raw materials, then for markets abroad, then to shift industry where manpower was cheaper. As seen in the new age trading blocs the US-led IPEF, and the Chinese dominated RCEP economic interests lie at the heart of geopolitics.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>At a time when global rivalries are growing sharper in the shadow of the war in Europe, and as India looks out for its own interests, pushing powerful corporates to the centre-stage of its diplomacy, whether it is to build ports, buy or sell weapons or make chips, is inevitable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. Economic interests lie at the heart of geopolitics. Analyse this statement in context of India’s active push for infrastructure diplomacy by including private conglomerates like Adani in it.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Nepal is in a constitutional crisis with major organs of the state confronting each other as the Chief Justice is under undeclared house arrest and the PM openly criticizing the President.</p>
<h4>Nepal polity in turmoil</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prime Minister who is backed by the chiefs of four major coalition partners, is at loggerheads with President.</li>
<li>The President might seek to rule as an extra-constitutional authority beyond the sanction and imagination of the Constitution that completed six years last week.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Genesis of the crisis: Row over Citizenship</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current crisis began after President refused to ratify Nepal’s citizenship bill, which was sent to her twice after it was passed by both Houses of Parliament over the span of a month.</li>
<li>The bill seeks to give citizenship by birth and by descent to an estimated 500,000 individuals.</li>
<li>It was also sought to provide non-voting citizenship to non-resident Nepalis living in non-SAARC countries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Constitutional crisis in Nepal: A backgrounder</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nepal transitioned into a democracy beginning with the fall of the monarchy in 2006 and the subsequent election of the Maoist government in 2008.</li>
<li>The emergence of the multiparty system was followed by the adoption of a constitution on September 20, 2015.</li>
<li>All Nepalese citizens born before this date got naturalised citizenship.</li>
<li>But their children remained without citizenship as that was to be guided by a federal law which has not yet been framed.</li>
<li>This amendment Act was expected to pave the way to citizenship for many such stateless youth as well as their parents.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the issues with the Act?</h4>
<p><strong>Ans. <u>Gender bias</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main criticism against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2006 is that it goes against established parameters of gender justice.</li>
<li>According to Article 11(2b), a person born to a father or a mother with Nepalese citizenship can get citizenship by descent.</li>
<li>Another article says a person who is born to a Nepalese mother (who has lived in the country) and an unidentified father will also get citizenship by descent.</li>
<li>But this section appears humiliating for a mother as she has to declare that her husband is unidentified for the child to be eligible for citizenship.</li>
<li>In case of a Nepalese father, such declarations are not required.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why has the President refused to sign the Act?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bhandari is the first female President of Nepal.</li>
<li>Her refusal to sign the Act has drawn attention to certain sections in the constitution that thrusts greater responsibility on women.</li>
<li>For example, Article 11 (5) says that a person who is born to a Nepalese mother and an unidentified father can be granted citizenship by descent.</li>
<li>Next, it says that in case the unidentified father turns out to be a foreigner, the citizenship by descent would be converted to naturalised citizenship.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it supports punitive action against the mother if the father is found later.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Indian connection to the issue</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is an unarticulated concern in the orthodox sections that Nepalese men, particularly from the Terai region, continue to marry women from northern India.</li>
<li>These people feel that Nepalese identity would be undermined.</li>
<li>Because of this “Beti-Roti” (Nepalese men marrying Indian women) issue, many women could not become citizens of Nepal.</li>
<li>They were subjected to the infamous seven-year cooling off period before they could apply for citizenship in Nepal.</li>
<li>As such women were stateless, children of such families were also often found to be without Nepalese citizenship.</li>
<li>However, the new amendments have done away with the cooling off period for these stateless women.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The death of a 12-year-old girl in Pathanamthitta has sharpened the focus on the rising number of rabies cases and the growing population of stray dogs in Kerala</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is rabies?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system of the host, and in humans, it can cause a range of debilitating symptoms including states of anxiety and confusion, partial paralysis, agitation, hallucinations, and, in its final phases, a symptom called “hydrophobia,” or a fear of water.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are rabies caused by?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system of mammals, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Can rabies person survive?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. Less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How long can a human live with rabies?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Death usually occurs 2 to 10 days after first symptoms. Survival is almost unknown once symptoms have presented, even with intensive care.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="rabies" class="alignnone wp-image-639696" height="574" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infographic-300x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infographic-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infographic-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infographic-768x766.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infographic.jpg 876w" width="574"/>Facts on rabies </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>What animal has the most rabies?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bats</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wild animals accounted for 92.7% of reported cases of rabies in 2018. Bats were the most frequently reported rabid wildlife species (33% of all animal cases during 2018), followed by raccoons (30.3%), skunks (20.3%), and foxes (7.2%).</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="rabies" class="alignnone wp-image-639698" height="417" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/straydogs-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/straydogs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/straydogs.jpg 621w" width="626"/>What is the issue?                                   </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is a blame game over the rising rabies cases:</strong> With the rabies deaths causing panic and reports of residents killing stray dogs through poisoning and strangulation, there is a blame game over the rising canine population and rabies cases. Some legal experts blame it on conflicts in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001; others point to the flawed implementation of birth control measures.</li>
<li><strong>Legal battle over the issue in the Supreme Court:</strong> Canine culling campaigners and advocates of animal rights are also engaged in a protracted legal battle over the issue in the Supreme Court. V.K. Biju, a lawyer of the Supreme Court, who brought the issue of the “stray dog menace” before the apex court, contends that the root cause is the enactment of the Rules, which according to him, were passed in contravention of the parent Act, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of stray dogs has adversely affected the fundamental rights of citizens</strong>: Biju says that while the Act stands for the “destruction” of stray dogs, the rules are against the “destruction” of stray dogs, including the rabies affected ones, besides providing specific protection of stray dogs. In his submission before the Supreme Court, he argues that the existence of stray dogs has adversely affected the fundamental rights of citizens, i.e. the right to life and free movement.</li>
<li><strong>The quashing of the Rules to make India free of stray dogs</strong>: In his writ petition filed before the apex court, Biju has sought orders for the strict implementation of the Act and the quashing of the Rules to make India free of stray dogs.</li>
<li><strong>Animal rights campaigners are apprehensive</strong>: In the light of this, animal rights campaigners are apprehensive over the campaign to cull dogs to check rabies.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="rabies" class="alignnone wp-image-639697" height="505" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infection-from-dog-to-human-300x261.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infection-from-dog-to-human-300x261.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rabies-infection-from-dog-to-human.jpg 500w" width="580"/>How can we prevent rabies in animals?</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>First, visit your veterinarian with your pet on a regular basis and keep rabies vaccinations up-to-date for all cats, ferrets, and dogs.</li>
<li>Second, maintain control of your pets by keeping cats and ferrets indoors and keeping dogs under direct supervision.</li>
<li>Third, spay or neuter your pets to help reduce the number of unwanted pets that may not be properly cared for or vaccinated regularly.</li>
<li>Finally, call animal control to remove all stray animals from your neighbourhood since these animals may be unvaccinated or ill.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>How can we prevent rabies in humans?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Leave all wildlife alone.</li>
<li>Know the risk: contact with infected bats is the leading cause of rabies deaths in people followed by exposure to rabid dogs while traveling internationally.</li>
<li>Wash animal bites or scratches immediately with soap and water.</li>
<li>If you are bitten, scratched, or unsure, talk to a healthcare provider about whether you need postexposure prophylaxis. Rabies in people is 100% preventable through prompt appropriate medical care.</li>
<li>Vaccinate your pets to protect them and your family.</li>

The ideal garden city was planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks and boulevards, housing 32,000 people on 6,000 acres, linked to a central city with over 50,000 people. Once a garden city reached maximum capacity, another city would be developed nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Neighbourhood concept</strong>: In the US, the garden city movement evolved into the neighbourhood concept, where residential houses and streets were organised around a local school or community centre, with a push for lowering traffic and providing safe roads. London has a metropolitan green belt around the city, covering 5,13,860 hectares of land, to offset pollution and congestion and maintain biodiversity. Why can’t Indian cities have something similar, instead of ring roads and urban sprawls?</li>
<li><strong>La ville du quart d’heure: </strong>Paris has taken this forward with the “15-minute city” (‘la ville du quart d’heure’). The idea is rather simple, every Parisian should be able to do their shopping, work, and recreational activities and fulfil their cultural needs within a 15-minute walk or bike ride this means that the number of vehicular trips gets reduced significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in pedestrian infrastructure and non-motorised transport zones</strong>: A city would then be planned for pedestrians, instead of cars and motors. This requires an extensive usage of mixed-use developments, along with investment in pedestrian infrastructure and non-motorised transport zones. Instead of widening highways, this approach would push for widening pedestrian walkways.</li>

<h4><strong>What should be adopted for India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every Indian city should ideally have a Master Plan</strong>: A strategic urban planning document which would be updated every decade or two. The document would entail how a city is supposed to grow, vertically and horizontally, across zones, while offering a high quality of life in a sustainable manner. Such plans would also consider poverty mitigation, affordable housing and liveability for urban migrants.</li>
<li><strong>Urban land use needs to be better</strong>: One look at satellite map imagery will show that India’s urban growth is increasingly haphazard, with informal, unplanned and sprawling neighbourhoods developing in paddy fields and along linear infrastructure (arterial roads, open spaces). India’s hidden urbanisation, driven partly by our stringent definition of the word, along with weak enforcement of building codes, has meant that the local government is often playing catch-up, unable to provide urban services and infrastructure to keep up with growth.</li>
<li><strong>Public land availability</strong>: Meanwhile, in places where there are formally recognised towns and urban neighbourhoods, outdated planning practices have meant that land utilisation is poor. Consider the case of Mumbai, where almost 1/4th of the land is open public space while over half of it is the underutilised space around buildings, which is enclosed by walls and hived off from public access. Such open spaces, if available, would help cities like Mumbai achieve similar ratios as globally benchmarked cities (Amsterdam, Barcelona) in public land availability (typically above 40 per cent).</li>
<li><strong>India’s urban density will also need to be thought through</strong>: Dense construction on the peripheries of our major cities (for instance, dense construction in Delhi’s suburbs, like Noida and Gurugram) will inevitably mean that public services are stretched and emissions (due to transportation to the main city) remain high. Such urbanisation will unavoidably lock India into a high emissions future while making our cities prone to extreme heat and flooding.</li>
<li><strong>Then there is climate change: </strong>According to the World Bank, climate change may reduce India’s GDP by 3 per cent, while depressing the living standards of its citizens by 2050. Many urban experts cite technological solutions that may save our cities a chain of sea walls, river embankments and reclamations, for instance from such potential calamities. However, structural engineering simply may not be an economically and environmentally feasible option everywhere instead, our focus must be on conservation.</li>
<li><strong>Climate resilience perspective</strong> Bengaluru, with its network of interconnected lakes, could have considered Bangkok-style ferries instead of draining out its lakes. All ongoing and upcoming urban infrastructure projects must be reconsidered from a future climate resilience perspective does the ongoing sea reclamation for the upcoming coastal road in Mumbai make sense if sea levels are rising?</li>
<li><strong>Establishing a sense of cityhood</strong>: By making a push for a city as a co-created space will also require building up institutional capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing lack of town planning education: </strong>India would ideally require 3,00,000 town and country planners by 2031 (there are just 5,000 town planners currently). Much of this problem is fundamentally due to a lack of town planning education in the country there are just 26 institutes that provide this course, producing 700 town planners each year. We already have a shortage of 1.1 million planners. More schools are needed, with a push for local IITs and NITs to have a standalone planning department. With over 8,000 towns and cities, there is a clear unmet need.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Our policymakers also need to be cognisant of the historical context of our urban development a push for glass buildings or utilising granite may not always be suitable for our cities. Why can’t our cities look distinctly Indian, inspired by our historical architecture? Renewing our cities will require us to rethink various urban topics, including urban design, urban healthcare, affordable housing, sustainability and inclusion among others. Our urban future depends on getting this right.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/functioning-of-the-national-investigation-agency-nia/">National Investigation Agency (NIA)</a> has launched a massive nationwide search operation in connection with anti-terror activities linked to the Popular Front of India-PFI.</p>
<h4><strong>What is the Popular Front of India (PFI)?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The PFI was created in 2007 through the merger of three radicalists organisations in southern India, the National Democratic Front in Kerala, the Karnataka Forum for Dignity, and the Manitha Neethi Pasarai in Tamil Nadu.</li>
<li>A decision to bring the three outfits together was taken in November 2006 at a meeting in Kozhikode in Kerala.</li>
<li>The formation of the PFI was formally announced at a rally in Bengaluru during what was called the “Empower India Conference” on February 16, 2007.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Agenda of the PFI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The PFI has projected itself as an organisation that fights for the rights of minorities, Dalits, and marginalised communities.</li>
<li>It has frequently targeted the alleged anti-people policies of the State even as these mainstream parties have accused one another of being in cahoots with the PFI to gather the support of Muslims at the time of elections.</li>
<li>The PFI has itself never contested elections.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Parallel organizations to PFI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2009, a political outfit named Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) evolved out of the PFI, with the aim of taking up the political issues of Muslims, Dalits, and other marginalised communities.</li>
<li>The SDPI’s stated goal is advancement and uniform development of all the citizenry including Muslims, Dalits, Backward Classes and Adivasis and to share power fairly among all the citizens.</li>
<li>The PFI is a key provider of ground workers for the SDPI’s political activities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why is PFI under crackdown?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>(1) Links to terror outfits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many volunteers of PFI are allegedly involved in terror funding, organising training camps, and radicalising people to join proscribed organisations.</li>
<li>It has been involved in carrying out social and Islamic religious work among Muslims on the lines of the work done by right-wing groups.</li>
<li>The PFI does not maintain records of its members, and it has been difficult for law enforcement agencies to pin crimes on the organisation after making arrests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Promoting Radicalization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The outfit is hostile to the consolidation across the country and the rise of a single non-secular party as the nation’s pre-eminent political and ideological force.</li>
<li>The post-2014 political landscape and the self-alienation of minorities has further pushed sections of the community towards groups like the PFI.</li>
<li>The outfit is also said to have a large number of supporters in Gulf countries who contribute handsomely to its kitty, something which is under the scanner of investigating agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Hostility against state mechanism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting out as an organisation primarily rooted in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the PFI has spread its wings far and wide, with a presence in at least 18 states.</li>
<li>It has found particularly fertile ground in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Assam.</li>
<li>Authorities have accused the outfit of instigating and funding protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Barbarism in the name of religion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PFI has had the most visible presence in Kerala, where it has been repeatedly accused of murder, rioting, intimidation, and having links with terrorist organisations.</li>
<li>The Kerala government affidavit said PFI activists were involved in 27 cases of MURDER, mostly of CPM and RSS cadres, and that the motives were highly communal.</li>

<p>The Sittanavasal Rock Cave Temple, a major centre of Jain influence for 1,000 years just before the Christian era, is in need of better upkeep.</p>
<h4><strong>Sittanavasal</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sittanavasal is a small hamlet in Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu, India.</li>
<li>It is known for the Sittanavasal Cave, a 2nd-century Jain cave complex. From the 7th to the 9th century A.D., the village flourished as a Jain centre.</li>
<li>Sittanavasal is the name used synonymously for the hamlet and the hillock that houses the:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arivar Kovil</strong> (temple of Arihants — Jains who conquered their senses)</li>
<li><strong>Ezhadipattam</strong> (a cavern with 17 polished rock beds), megalithic burial sites and the</li>
<li><strong>Navachunai</strong> tarn (small mountain lake) with a submerged shrine</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>What makes it special?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The artwork on the ceiling of the sanctum and the ardha mandapam of Arivar Kovil is an early example of post-Ajanta cave paintings of the fourth to sixth centuries.</li>
<li>It was also done using the fresco-secco technique (a process that dispenses with preparation of the wall with wet plaster).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Features of the cave paintings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ceiling paintings show ‘<strong><u>bhavyas’</u></strong> (exalted souls who work to achieve moksha or spiritual liberation) enjoying themselves in a pool, full of lotuses; today much of it is obscured by patchy plastering.</li>
<li>Faint outlines linger of dancing girls on the ‘<strong><u>ardha mandapam</u></strong>’ pillars.</li>
<li>The colours are a mixture of plant dyes and mineral elements such as <strong><u>lime, lamp black, and clay pigments</u></strong> such as ochre for yellow and terre verte for the greyish-green tints.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why in news now?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Unrestricted public access and general exposure to the elements have led to a gradual fading away of these paintings.</li>
<li>At the Ezhadipattam, inscriptions have been vandalised beyond recognition.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There are certain tribal communities who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward.</li>
<li>They generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and administrative support.</li>
<li>These groups are among the most vulnerable section of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any significant level of social and economic development.</li>
<li>75 such groups have been identified and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Origin of the concept</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><u>Dhebar Commission (1960-1961)</u></strong> stated that within Scheduled Tribes there existed an inequality in the rate of development.</li>
<li>During the fourth Five Year Plan a sub-category was created within Scheduled Tribes to identify groups that considered to be at a lower level of development.</li>
<li>This was created based on the Dhebar Commission report and other studies.</li>
<li>This sub-category was named “Primitive tribal group”.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Features of PVTGs</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The features of such a group include a:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Pre-agricultural system of existence</li>
<li>Practice of hunting and gathering</li>
<li>Zero or negative population growth</li>
<li>Extremely low level of literacy in comparison with other tribal groups</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Groups that satisfied any one of the criterion were considered as PTG.</li>
<li>In 2006 the government of India proposed to rename “Primitive tribal group” as Particularly vulnerable tribal group”.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Try this PYQ:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Q.Consider the following statements about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>PVTGs reside in 18 States and one Union Territory.</li>
<li>A stagnant or declining population is one of the criteria for determining PVTG status.</li>
<li>There are 95 PVTGs officially notified in the country so far.</li>
<li>Irular and Konda Reddi tribes are included in the list of PVTGs.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Rohini</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><img alt="rohini" class="alignnone wp-image-640536 size-full" height="437" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rohini-1.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rohini-1.jpg 591w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rohini-1-300x222.jpg 300w" width="591"/></p>
<p>In a few weeks’ time, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to achieve a remarkable feat — the 200th successful launch of the Rohini RH-200 sounding rocket in a row.</p>
<h4>Rohini RH-200</h4>
<ul>
<li>RH-200 is a two-stage rocket capable of climbing to a height of 70 km bearing scientific payloads.</li>
<li>The first and second stages of RH-200 are powered by solid motors. The ‘200’ in the name denotes the diameter of the rocket in mm.</li>
<li>Other operational Rohini variants are RH-300 Mk-II and RH-560 Mk-III.</li>
<li>For years, the RH-200 rocket had used a polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-based propellant.</li>
<li>The first RH-200 to use a new propellant based on hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) was successfully flown from the TERLS in September 2020.</li>
<li>The first and second stages of RH200 rocket are powered by solid motors.</li>
<li>Since inception of RH200 rocket, both solid stages are processed using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based propellant.</li>
<li>As compared to PVC based propellants, HTPB based propellant is more energetic, higher mechanical &amp; interface properties and has less defects due to lower processing temperature.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What basically is a Sounding Rocket?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A sounding rocket is an instrument-carrying rocket designed to take measurements and perform scientific experiments during its sub-orbital flight.</li>
<li>The rockets are used to launch instruments from 48 to 145 km above the surface of the Earth, the altitude generally between weather balloons and satellites.</li>
<li>The maximum altitude for balloons is about 40 km and the minimum for satellites is approximately 121 km.</li>
</ul>
<h4>History of sounding rockets in India</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sounding rockets have an important place in the ISRO story.</li>
<li>The first sounding rocket to be launched from Thumba was the American Nike-Apache — on November 21, 1963.</li>
<li>After that, two-stage rockets imported from Russia (M-100) and France (Centaure) were flown. The ISRO launched its own version — Rohini RH-75 — in 1967.</li>
<li>The ISRO has launched more than 1,600 RH-200 rockets so far.</li>
<li>Currently, the RH200, RH300 MkII and RH560 Mk-III rockets are operational which were developed during the early phase of our journey in rocketry.</li>

<h4><strong>What is Oil Palm?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp of the fruit of the oil palms.</li>
<li>The oil is used in food manufacturing, in beauty products, and as biofuel.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is APOA?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Through APOA, the countries aim at safeguarding the economic and business interests of the palm oil consuming countries and will work towards increasing the consumption of palm oil in member countries.</li>
<li>The idea is to gain collecting bargaining power and make imports sustainable.</li>
<li>APOA held its first general body meeting on the side-lines of the Globoil Summit.</li>
<li>The industry associations of Asian palm oil importing countries, unlike their counterparts in Europe, are not involved in shaping the global discourse on sustainable palm oil in a collective way.</li>
<li>The alliance would work towards ensuring that palm oil is recognised as a high-quality, economical, and healthy vegetable oil and to change the negative image of palm oil.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why such move?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s annual imports of edible oil is around 13-14 million tonne (MT).</li>
<li>Around 8 MT of palm oil is imported from Indonesia and Malaysia, while other oils, such as soya and sunflower, come from Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and Russia.</li>
<li>Asia accounts for around 40% of the global palm oil consumption while Europe accounts for 12% of palm oil trade.</li>
<li>Indonesia and Malaysia are the biggest palm oil exporters in the world.</li>
<li>India is the largest importer of palm oil in Asia, accounting for 15% of global imports, followed by China (9%), Pakistan (4%) and Bangladesh (2%).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4>Try this PYQ:</h4>
<p><strong>Q.Among the agricultural commodities imported by India, which one of the following accounts for the highest imports in terms of value in the last five years?</strong></p>
<p>(a) Spices</p>
<p>(b) Fresh fruits</p>
<p>(c) Pulses</p>
<p>(d) Vegetable oils</p>

<ul>
<li>Discrimination in employment is a worldwide phenomenon. Gender, ethnic, racist discrimination are well known but discrimination towards neurodiverse persons are hardly debated in public forums. Despite having special abilities companies are not using their potentials.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-neurodiversity-202111232645#:~:text=The%20word%20neurodiversity%20refers%20to,as%20ADHD%20or%20learning%20disabilities." rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>What is </strong><strong>neurodiversity?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Harvard Health Publishing defines, neurodiversity as a notion that every person interacts and experiences their surroundings differently; there is no right way of thinking, learning, or/and behaving. These differences should not be construed as defects or disorders.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is a neuro-diverse workplace?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Neurodiversity in the workplace refers to including people with neuro-divergent conditions such as attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and Asperger’s Syndrome.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are those Conditions that make them different from normal humans?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autism:</strong> A mental condition in which a person finds it difficult to communicate or form relationships with other people. Signs of autism include not responding to their name, avoiding eye contact, not smiling when you smile at them.</li>
<li><strong>Dyslexia:</strong> a difficulty that some people have with reading and spelling signs include confusion over letters that look similar and putting letters the wrong way round , confusing the order of letters in words, reading slowly or making errors when reading aloud</li>
<li><strong>Asperger’s syndrome:</strong> A developmental disorder related to autism and characterized by awkwardness in social interaction, pedantry in speech, and preoccupation with very narrow interests. Less severe symptoms than Autism syndrome.</li>
<li><strong>Dyscalculia:</strong> A brain disorder in which a wide range of difficulties with math, including weaknesses in understanding the meaning of numbers, and difficulty applying mathematical principles to solve problems.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>More efficient: </strong>Studies have shown that teams with both neurodivergent and neurotypical members are far more efficient than teams that comprise neurotypical employees alone.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to focus: </strong>Neurodivergent individuals possess excellent attention to detail and an uncanny ability to focus on complex and repetitive tasks over a more extended period than their neurotypical peers.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to work at faster speed: </strong>A study by the University of Montreal found that in a test involving completing a visual pattern, people on the autism spectrum could finish their task 40% faster than those who were not on the spectrum.</li>
<li><strong>Robust spatial reasoning</strong>: People with dyslexia can think about objects in three dimensions and analyses such objects even with limited information.</li>
<li><strong>Out of box thinking</strong>: They have problem-solving capabilities which allow them to see multiple solutions to a problem. They are often out-of-the-box thinkers with average or above-average intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Current Status of people living with neurodivergent conditions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>People suffer with the Condition: </strong>According to a recent report, nearly 2 million people in India suffer from this neurological and developmental disorder and are therefore identified as autistic. Another study by Deloitte estimates that nearly 20% of the world is neurodiverse. In the U.S., it is estimated that 85% of people on the autism spectrum are unemployed compared with 4.2% of the overall population</li>
<li><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/india-discrimination-report/"><strong>Discrimination at employment</strong>:</a> Even with all the necessary skill sets and degrees, these persons are denied a job because they may react to situations differently from non-neurodiverse persons.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of awareness: </strong>Lack of awareness about neurodivergent conditions, and how the people with condition may react and lack of and accommodating environment. Hence, there is an urgency to create a work environment that welcomes neurodiverse individuals<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A 2019 McKinsey study revealed that companies with gender diversity were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability while those with ethnic diversity out-rival their competitors by 36%.</li>
<li>Another report titled ‘India’s Best Workplaces in Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion 2021’ states that diverse teams perform better, boost leadership integrity, heighten trust in the organization’s management and multiply revenue growth.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Competitive environment</strong>: Organisations embracing neurodiversity enjoy a competitive edge in several areas such as efficiency, creativity, and culture.</li>
<li><strong>Various MNC’s hiring program</strong>: Companies such as Deloitte, Microsoft, SAP, JPMorgan Chase, and E&amp;Y have introduced neurodiversity hiring programs.</li>
<li><strong>Indian company: </strong>Indian-origin companies Hatti Kaapi and Lemon Tree Hotels have also included a neurodiverse workforce.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What can be done to create more inclusive workplaces?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating neurodivergent friendly offices</strong>: .Many employees with neurodiversity may find the hustle and bustle of a traditional office disturbing. Therefore, neurodivergent friendly offices catering to the employees’ diverse sensory responses can help ensure that these employees are comfortable in office spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Openness:</strong> Creating the right environment is an ever-evolving exercise that requires openness and a will to change on the employer’s part. This flexibility can result in exceptional benefit with minimal or no additional costs.</li>
<li><strong>Wider Inclusivity</strong>: To ensure higher profitability and be respected as a responsible employer globally, companies need to widen their definition of inclusivity by providing higher participation of a neurodiverse workforce.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Organizations must not only remove barriers that obstruct the progress of such individuals but also create conducive conditions for them to achieve their true potential and providing proper infrastructure so that they can perform at their optimal levels.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Increased interest, especially by smaller nations in the world, in investing more and doing well in elite sports in international sporting events boosts a nation’s chances of attaining soft power.</li>
<li>India’s medal tally at recent International sports events demonstrate the country’s soft power on the global stage and encourage working towards the status of a great “geopolitical actor”.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.bridgeindia.org.uk/the-rise-of-india-as-a-global-soft-power/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>What is soft power?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong>
<ul>
<li>As far back as the 4<sup>th</sup> century BC, Kautilya (chankyaniti) had propounded the concept of Saam(advice or cajole),daam(pay or bribe),dand(punish),bhed(exploit secrets) which acquired western touch and can be understood by Soft power, smart power, hard power, and sharp power respectively.</li>
<li>Joseph Nye introduced the concept of “soft power” in the late 1980s. For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong></li>
<li>Soft power is the ability of a country to persuade others to do what it wants without force or coercion.</li>
<li>Soft power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="soft power" class="alignnone wp-image-640547" height="327" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1332880749-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1332880749-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1332880749-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1332880749-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1332880749.jpg 1200w" width="491"/><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/sansad-tv-perspective-yoga-indias-soft-power/">Why Soft power is so significant?</a></strong></h4>
<p>Use of ‘Soft Power’ includes the number of cultural missions such as language schools, Olympic Medals and the quality of a country’s overall growth. Soft power produces following things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Familiarity</strong>: If people know more about your country, culture, sports, and its talents, businesses, and resources, then soft power is enhanced.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation</strong>: For a nation to be attractive and a role model for others, its overall reputation must be strong and positive.</li>
<li><strong>Influence</strong>: A direct measure of the perceived presence and impact that your country has in other countries</li>
<li><strong>Business/Innovation/Sports</strong>: The attractiveness of a country’s economic model, its digital engagement with the world, performance in sports etc.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong>: Showcases the ability of country’s political leadership and what it delivers to its people in different arenas.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Alignment:</strong> As a country rises up the ‘Soft Power’ list, more and more outside parties align themselves with the common goals of that country.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why the Sports being used as a tool of soft power in modern international relations?</strong></h4>
<p>Sport can be used as tool of soft power both internationally and domestically.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>International platform</strong>: Sports provide a platform for countries to showcase their culture, values and tradition.</li>
<li><strong>Puts a Better image of a country</strong>: Sports as a tool to achieve social, political, and financial goals, and improve the image of the country<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>International exposure: </strong>The focus on culture and peaceful values in sports make it a useful tool for countries to use soft power to achieve international goals and improve their public diplomacy.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing differences</strong>: Sports provides a platform for trust-building; and reconciliation, integration and anti-racism.</li>
<li><strong>Learning from China’s Case</strong>:</li>
<li>Dongfeng Liu (International Professor of Sport Management) in his survey on China’s performance in the Olympics he found that a country’s Olympic achievement has a positive effect on its national soft power.</li>
<li>As china is a communist country and reputation about human rights is not good, so China uses its superiority in elite sports to build “people-to-people” relations with other countries. For example, athletes from African countries such as Madagascar are trained in swimming, badminton, table tennis, etc. in China, which helps Beijing create a positive impact on a wider population and result in better formal relations as well.</li>
<li>There is also China’s memorandum of understanding with countries such as Kenya so that Chinese runners can train with Kenyan athletes, as they are among the best in the world when it comes to long-distance running.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="soft power" class="alignnone wp-image-640550" height="512" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/80906-yutjpg-1554537206-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/80906-yutjpg-1554537206-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/80906-yutjpg-1554537206.jpg 640w" width="683"/>Introspection on India’s performance at recent International Sports events</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is being said that the golden period of Indian sports may have begun as at the Tokyo Olympics and then the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games (CWG) are examples of a good performance.</li>
<li>India’s medal tally in the Tokyo Olympics Games — seven — was its most decorated Olympic Games in Indian history.</li>
<li>At the Commonwealth games (CWG) 2022, Indian athletes won 61 medals, including 22 gold.</li>
<li>India has one of the world’s poorest population-to-medal ratios when it comes to the Olympics.</li>
<li>Ensuring competent coaches, and having adequate funding and more sports academics still remain major issues even decades later</li>
<li>India spends only three paise per day per capita on sports. In contrast China spends 1 per day per capita.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What can be done to increase the country’s sporting performance and soft power</strong><strong>?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Train Indian players overseas:</strong></li>
<li>India should concentrate on forging MoUs with nations that excel in specific sports and train Indian players overseas.</li>
<li>For example, Australia and the United Kingdom can assist us in swimming given their standing here.</li>
<li>When it comes to running, negotiating collaborative training agreements with African countries such as Kenya would be ideal.</li>
<li><strong>No Politics over assistance: </strong></li>
<li>There should be no politics in seeking or even offering assistance.</li>
<li>For example China has requested Indian assistance in improving cricket development in China (Chongqing city).</li>
<li><strong>Private Investment</strong>:</li>
<li>Private investment needs to be harnessed to develop infrastructure. The better a country performs in sporting events the greater a sports person’s interest in their sports atmosphere. This also creates a huge market for private players to invest in.</li>
<li>For example, leading corporate houses in India have already shown how their active participation and investment can improve sporting performance as a result of unique corporate sports programmes.</li>
<li><strong>Public –private partnership at grass root :</strong></li>
<li>The Government should also work on a public-private partnership (PPP) model to create basic sporting infrastructure.</li>
<li>As recommended by NITI Aayog, at the district level too so that talent can be captured at an early stage.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sports as a tool of soft power had always been a key element of leadership from the ancient times. Sports provide an international platform to develop an attitude of unity in a divided multi-polar modern world.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains Question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Sports provide an international platform to develop an attitude of unity and influence others in a divided multi-polar modern world. Discuss in this context that soft power is not an end but a means to an end.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Law enforcement</strong><strong>: </strong>The basic role of the police is to function as a law enforcement agency and render impartial service to law, without any heed to wishes, indications or desires expressed by the government which either come in conflict with or do not conform to the provisions contained in the constitution or laws.</li>
<li><strong>Service delivery</strong><strong>:</strong> The police should have duly recognised service-oriented role in providing relief to people in distress situations. They should be trained and equipped to perform the service oriented functions.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are Issues with police institution in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonial practice</strong>: The Police Act of 1861, which governs substantially the functioning of police even today, is a symbol of colonial rule.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of internal security on economic growth</strong>: Economic development depends on sound law and order and we can have good law and order only if we have professional police. According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, violence cost the country 7 per cent of its GDP in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Infiltration of persons of questionable background at power:</strong> According to the Association of Democratic Reforms, the percentage of such people in Parliament has been showing a steady upward trend. It was 24 per cent in 2004, 30 per cent in 2009, 34 per cent in 2014 and 43 per cent in the last election held in 2019.This poses a challenge for police to take action against this segment of people and their supporters who have a shady background and who may one day devour the very system that has placed them in power.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Internal security doctrine:</strong> Problems are tackled as per the perception of the ruling dispensation at any given point time and therefore police are not able to deal with the internal security challenges as effectively as they should.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of confidence of public in police:</strong> Most people believe police to be abusive and also believe that police personnel misuse their power in order to bring order to society. This is particularly true of the lower strata of society, who feel that there is one law for the poor and another for the rich and powerful as police under influence of political and financial clout.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing complexity of organized crimes</strong>: Organised crime has acquired international dimensions. Arms trafficking and drug trafficking do not observe any borders and Cybercrimes are increasing in geometrical progression.<strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong> Poor infrastructure and human resource: </strong>The police are not able to deliver partly because of poor infrastructure moreover there is a vacancy of more than 5,00,000 personnel.</li>
<li><strong>Poor housing conditions and long working hours:</strong> poor housing conditions and long working hours have an adverse impact on police performance.  According to the Status of Policing in India Report, 2019, an average policeman works for 14 hours a day and does not get any weekly off. This takes a heavy toll on his mental and physical health.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is meant by police reforms?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The aim of Police reforms is to enhance efficiency, capability, and adoptability according to the time and transforming culture, values and existing practice of police system.</li>
<li>As per the Indian Constitution Police comes under state list.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What can be done to improve <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/reforms-police-in-india-need/">efficiency of police in India</a>?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Police sensitisation about their role in society: </strong>The sensitisation module should aim at bringing about attitudinal change in police — especially pertaining to gender and power relations and police behavior. It is necessary to increase public confidence in the police by upgrading levels of police service delivery as well as by investigating and acting in cases of police misconduct<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increasing accountability</strong><strong>: </strong>Making them answerable to law and law alone and not to work under pressure of the political and financial clout.</li>
<li><strong>Develop infrastructure and fill vacancies:</strong> Overall, there is a vacancy of more than 5,00,000 personnel. These must be filled. There is huge scope for improvement in transport, communications and forensics as well</li>
<li><strong>Improving hosing conditions:</strong> The National Police Commission had recommended 100 per cent family accommodation for all non gazetted police personnel. The satisfaction level today is hardly 31.24 per cent.</li>
<li><strong> Reducing working hours:</strong> Long working hours have an adverse impact on police performance. We should have 12-hour shifts straightaway and gradually aim to achieve eight-hour shifts.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A new role and new philosophy have to be defined for the police to not only make it a capable and effective body but also one accountable to the law of the land and to the people whom they serve.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>If the country is to progress and emerge as a great power, there is no alternative to radical reforms in the police. Discuss.</strong></p></blockquote>
