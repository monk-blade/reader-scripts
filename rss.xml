<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Trade and settlement of payments in rupee</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>A number of countries, including India, are now considering the use of other currencies to avoid the U.S. dollar and its hegemonic role in settling international transactions.</p>
<h4>Currency hierarchy</h4>
<ul>
<li>For India, currency hierarchy goes back to colonial times when the Indian rupee was virtually <strong>linked to the British pound</strong> rather than to gold which it earned through exports.</li>
<li>In the post-War period, the neo-colonial currency hierarchy has been clubbed with the continued use, primarily of the U.S. dollar, for the majority of international transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rupee settlement of trade</h4>
<ul>
<li>In recent times, India has been taking an active interest in having the rupee used for trade and the settlement of payments with other countries, which include Russia, now facing sanctions.</li>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India has recently taken a proactive stand to have rupee settlement of trade (circular dated July 11, 2022).</li>
<li>While options for invoicing in rupees were already legal in terms of Regulation 7(1) of the <strong>Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016,</strong> the current circular aims to operationalise the special<strong> Vostro accounts with Russian banks in India</strong>, in a bid to promote trade and also gain a better status for the rupee as an international currency.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Opportunities for India</h4>
<ul>
<li>The advantages India is currently seeking in these arrangements include avoidance of transactions in the highly priced dollar which has an exchange value of ₹80, impacting the Indian economy with inflation, capital flight and the <strong>drop in foreign exchange reserves</strong> by $70 billion since September 2021.</li>
<li> Buying oil with a depreciated ruble, and at discounts, is not only cost-saving but also saves transport time with the use of multi-modal routes using land, sea and air routes.</li>
<li>In addition, India is looking forward to trade expansion in sanctions-affected Russia.</li>
<li>With India having a trade deficit with Russia, which has been around $<strong>3.52 billion</strong> on average over the last two financial years, India’s opportunities include the possible use, by Russia, of the surpluses in the Vostro rupee account in Russian banks for additional purchases from India.</li>
<li><strong>Past attempts</strong>: Attempts to use the rupee for invoicing and trading is, however, not new to India.</li>
<li>A comprehensive bilateral trade and payments agreement was signed by India in 1953 with the Soviet bloc countries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are quite a few problems that may prevail in implementing the desired rupee payments and avoiding dollar transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Willingness of banks and private parties:</strong> Apart from issues that concern an agreed<strong> exchange rate</strong> between the rupee and the ruble (R-R), two volatile currencies, there is also the question of the willingness of private parties (companies, banks) to accept the rupee for trade and settlements.</li>
<li> If Russia opens its door for exports from India, the ‘R-R’ route may prove attractive for Indian exporters.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns of the US:</strong> There are official concerns for reactions, particularly from the U.S., to deals, especially for purchase of the S-400 defence equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction of the Europe:</strong> Moreover, the deals between India and Russia, especially on oil, can be considered by the West as ‘indirect back door support’ — as India is importing Russian crude<strong> at 30% discount,</strong> processing at refineries in Gujarat which include Reliance, and then exporting those to the West.</li>
<li><strong>Trade deficit:</strong> There were attempts even before the novel coronavirus pandemic to initiate a clearing account on the BRICS platform.</li>
<li>The quantitative implications indicate a skewed pattern of transactions — with China having most of the trade surplus.</li>
<li>It is a pattern similar to what is happening in India-Russia trade at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The India-Soviet agreements of the past may provide a clue on how the current ‘R-R’ trade and the problems can be managed by initiating a push for Indian exports to Russia and, of course, avoiding all deals in dollars — benefiting both trade partners and countering, globally, the on-going currency hierarchy.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>European Union’s Digital Services Act</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 2- Need for personal data protection act</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>In a surprise development last week, the Government withdrew the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019, thereby abruptly halting the country’s quest for a national data protection law that had been in the works for over five years.</p>
<h4>Reasons for withdrawal of the Bill</h4>
<ul>
<li>The short circular issued by the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology states that considering the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) — it had proposed 81 amendments and made 12 recommendations — <strong>“a comprehensive legal framework is being worked on”. </strong></li>
<li>There is no elaboration on what such a “comprehensive legal framework” entails.</li>
<li><strong>Possible plan of action: </strong>The Government could enact a fresh privacy legislation or <strong>a comprehensive data protection law</strong> (covering both personal and non-personal data).</li>
<li><strong>Subsuming data protection in IT Act:</strong> Alternatively, it could subsume data protection under its ongoing attempts at revising the existing Information Technology Act, 2000.</li>
<li><strong>Digital markets law:</strong> It could also enact a digital markets law, along the lines of the<strong> European Union’s Digital Services Act</strong>, focusing on competition and innovation in the digital space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background of the introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the Supreme Court of India affirmed the right to privacy in  <strong>K.S. Puttaswamy judgment in 2017</strong>, the nine-judge Bench of the Court referred to the Government’s Office Memorandum constituting the<strong> B.N. Srikrishna Committee</strong> to suggest a draft Data Protection Bill.</li>
<li>The committee released its draft Personal Data Protection Bill in 2018, which was the first public articulation of a data protection law in India.</li>
<li>When the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, the majority emphasised that it believed that “there is a need for a proper legislative mechanism for data protection”.</li>
<li>In December 2019, the Government introduced the PDP Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha as a comprehensive personal data protection regime.</li>
<li>The Bill was referred to the JPC for its recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What were the issues with the Bill?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power to exemption with state:</strong> The Bill’s expansive exemptions <strong>allowed the state to exempt the entire application of the law</strong> simply as if it was “expedient” to do so in the interest of national security or public order.</li>
<li><strong>Powers without accountability:</strong> The PDP Bill, 2019 as well as the JPC’s version established a strong regulator (the Data Protection Authority) with a lot of power, but very little independence or accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Data localisation:</strong> The Bill imposed a s<strong>trong data localisation mandate</strong>, requiring companies to store all sensitive personal data and critical personal data (which was not defined) in India.</li>
<li><strong>Subsuming the personal and non-personal data:</strong> The JPC recommended subsuming the regulation of personal data and non-personal data within a single legislation, even though it undermined the Puttaswamy mandate to ensure protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why we need data protection law?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing internet use:</strong> India currently has over <strong>750 million Internet users</strong>, with the number only expected to increase in the future.</li>
<li>The Government is also making a strong push for a <strong>‘Digital India’,</strong> with increased focus on digitisation of access to health, ration, banking, insurance, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>There is<strong> a greater focus on the inter-linking of data,</strong> whether through facial recognition, Aadhaar, or the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Data breaches:</strong> At the same time, India has among the highest data breaches in the world.</li>
<li>Without a data protection law in place, the data of millions of Indians continues to be at risk of being exploited, sold, and misused without their consent.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of writ proceeding against corporate action:</strong> Unlike state action, corporate action or misconduct is not subject to writ proceedings in India.</li>
<li>This is because fundamental rights are, by and large, not enforceable against private non-state entities.</li>
<li>This leaves individuals with limited remedies against private actors.</li>
<li>A personal data protection legislation would remedy this lacuna by providing individuals with proper grievance redress options and creating sufficient deterrence among private actors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>It is imperative that the Government soon introduces a fresh data protection legislation, drawn after proper public consultation. Such a law should take into consideration the criticisms that have been raised by civil society as well as the private sector.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Tax buoyancy</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Tax-to-GDP ratio</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>What the data conclusively show is that the debate on the Indian economy should shift away from simplistic notions (borrowed from the West?) of the tax-GDP ratio being low in India.</p>
<h4>India’s low tax-to-GDP ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the stylised beliefs in India, and amongst some leading economic commentators both in India and abroad, is that our tax/GDP ratio is lower than what it “should” be.</li>
<li>This low tax-to-GDP ratio is blamed for a<strong> lower rate of investment</strong>, a<strong> higher fiscal deficit</strong>, and lower GDP growth — and all because the tax ratio is too low.</li>
<li>There can be reasonable doubts about the presumed links.</li>
<li>There are three important fiscal variables in the economy — <strong>taxes, fiscal deficit, and debt. </strong></li>
<li>They are inter-related — lower tax revenue means higher fiscal deficit, for the same level of expenditures, and higher deficit means higher debt.</li>
<li>All three, directly or indirectly, are assumed <strong>to affect growth and/or inflation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Analysing India’s tax-to-GDP ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two common observations on tax-to-GDP for India — first, it is low at around<strong> 10-11 per cent of GDP</strong> and it has stayed at close to that level for the last 20 years.</li>
<li>In 2019, it hit a decade low of 10 per cent of GDP, the same as in 2014.</li>
<li>Second, in comparison with our peers, it is much lower.</li>
<li>Hence, logic dictates that we should strive to increase it.</li>
<li>But which country should we compare India with?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with comparing tax-to-GDP with other countries</h4>
<ul>
<li>A common observation is to look at the tax-GDP ratio in G20 countries.</li>
<li><strong>Function of average level of per capita income:</strong> This is the beginning of a set of misinterpretations committed either knowingly, or unknowingly.</li>
<li>Because simple logic dictates that tax collected is <strong>a function of the average level of per capita income.</strong></li>
<li>Per capita income in the G20 varies from around $2,100 (India) to around $65,000 (US).</li>
<li>The 10-11 per cent figure for India is the tax/GDP <strong>ratio for taxes administered at the central level.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in data collection</strong>: Taxes in India, as in many other large, especially federal, countries, are collected at both a federal and state level.</li>
<li>And many economies have local (municipal) taxes as well. The tax collected is the sum of all these taxes.</li>
<li>Until now, collecting such disaggregated data for a large set of countries was challenging.</li>
<li>However, in a recent web publication, the IMF on their World Revenue Longitudinal Data set has published such data for all countries, from 1990-2019.</li>
<li>In this pre-pandemic year, among G20 economies, India’s tax-GDP (Xtax) ratio of 16.7 per cent was higher than that of China (15.9 per cent), Mexico (14.1 per cent), Indonesia (11.0 per cent), Saudi Arabia (5.9 per cent) and Turkey (15.9 per cent).</li>
<li>A more informative indicator of whether a country is taxing too much or too little in comparison with others is to look at the <strong>tax-GDP ratio adjusted for PPP per capita income.</strong></li>
<li>Prediction via a simple regression of tax-to-GDP on log PPP per capita GDP can yield one estimate of the tax gap — the difference between actual and actual adjusted for level of income.</li>
<li>The world average tax gap is -1.3 per cent;<strong> India is +1.2 per cent for the nine years 2011-2019.</strong></li>
<li>So, India’s tax GDP ratio averages 2.5 percentage points more than an average economy.</li>
<li>For every year for which data are available 1990-2019, India has had a positive tax gap — there is little evidence that a higher tax/GDP ratio helps growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How corporate tax cut helped India</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate tax cut 2019:</strong> For years, the advocacy in India was to increase revenue from corporate tax which is one of three major components of tax revenue, the other being income and indirect taxes.</li>
<li>In September 2019, Finance Minister going well against Indian established conventional wisdom, lowered the corporate tax rate by around 10 percentage points.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding triple whammy</strong>: Opponents said that empirical evidence around the world (for example, the US) meant that <strong>if tax rates were lowered, revenues would decline, the fisc would increase, as would inequality.</strong></li>
<li>A triple whammy that is best avoided.</li>
<li>However, now, three years later, we can assess the efficacy (or not) of this bold experiment.</li>
<li>For the three months April-June 2022, corporate tax revenues, y-o-y, are up 30 per cent.</li>
<li>Using fiscal 2019-20 as a base, corporate tax revenue has increased by 66 per cent, GDP by 33 per cent —<strong> an average tax buoyancy of 2.0 over three years. </strong></li>
<li>The previous largest tax buoyancy was in 2006-7 when the world was buoyant.</li>
<li>Tentatively, the tax-GDP ratio in the fiscal year 2022-23 will <strong>average over 18 per cent in India</strong>, a level close to Japan and the US.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In India, the debate should shift to expenditures, and quality of expenditures (and perhaps to reform of the direct tax code). In this regard, suggestion that freebies be critically examined is most timely and welcome.</p>

<hr/>
<h4> Back2Basics: Tax buoyancy and tax elasticity</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax buoyancy:</strong> The buoyancy of a tax system <b>measures the total response of tax revenue both to changes in</b>. <b>national income and to discretionary changes in tax policies over time</b>, and it is traditionally interpreted as the percentage change in revenue associated to a one percent change in income.</li>
<li>Tax elasticity: It refers to changes in tax revenue in response to <strong>changes in tax rate. </strong></li>
<li>For example, how tax revenue changes if the government reduces corporate income tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent indicate tax elasticity.</li>

<ul>
<li>India’s old age poverty will be big by 2050. Only 2% informal workers have invested in NPS.</li>
</ul>
<div aria-controls="exacc_WDwQY7CYD8uSseMPtuiLqA0_6" aria-expanded="true" aria-labelledby="exacc_WDwQY7CYD8uSseMPtuiLqA0_5" class="wWOJcd" role="button" tabindex="0">
<h4 aria-hidden="true" class="iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf" id="exacc_WDwQY7CYD8uSseMPtuiLqA0_5"><strong>What is the real definition of poverty?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><strong>Why is age a cause of poverty?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The “oldest-old”, aged 80 years or over, are less able to work than younger older persons; are more likely to have spent their savings; and are most in need of age-appropriate health and long-term personal care services.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How age induces poverty in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India has no legal provisions for income security of the elderly, making the impacts of ageing far harsher for those who are already economically vulnerable.</li>
<li>Deteriorating brain and muscle capacity are largely non-negotiable facts of life, limiting one’s ability to get a job or remain employed.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reasons for old age poverty</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><img alt="old age poverty" class="alignnone wp-image-628689" height="335" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066-768x576.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066.jpg 1024w" width="447"/></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency:</strong> A large section of the senior population in India is still dependent on the joint family set up for their senior care and post-retirement needs, with financial planning for retirement taking a back seat.</li>
<li><strong>High population</strong>: An increase in the number of seniors in India will reduce the percentage of India’s human resource capital and its ability to drive economic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Low insurance penetration</strong>: This highlights the inadequacy and underscores the critical need to streamline retirement planning schemes and strengthen the pension programs in the country. There is a lacks of social security framework.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Data to remember</strong></p>
<p>People employed in the unorganised sector form around 90 per cent of India’s workforce.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>How to assure wellness and dignity to elders?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Income security in the form of monthly pensions either state-assured or employment-linked has been one of the most prevalent modes of assuring continued wellness and dignity against the life-shock of ageing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="old age poverty" class="alignnone wp-image-628690" height="427" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2-300x212.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2-768x543.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2.jpg 1000w" width="604"/>Addressing the roadblock</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal pension program:</strong> Income security in later years stems from multiple sources such as pensions, insurances (medical and life), Investments. This provides an opportunity for India to create a universal pension program for its 1.3 billion people<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Financial incentives: </strong>There is a pressing need to promote and facilitate fiscal planning in the early years and supplement it with senior-friendly tax structures and integrated insurance products. Such measures can help provide multiple income options to seniors to help them embrace a lifestyle of their choice.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory mechanism: </strong>A regulatory mechanism will set a viable base rate for the interest accrued on senior citizen deposits and ensure market dips don’t affect retirement income and senior-specific saving plans.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Case study</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rwanda has achieved roughly 2 million voluntary micro-pension enrolments (30 per cent of its adult population) within three years by making digital account activation easy and simple for informal workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/centre-proposes-to-hike-monthly-pensions-for-the-elderly-poor-disabled-and-widows/"><strong>Government intervention to improve elderly wellness </strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A strong and sustained political commitment,</li>
<li>A statutory pension sector regulator,</li>
<li>A well-designed and low-cost NPS product architecture,</li>
<li>Credible and well-regulated NPS intermediaries,</li>
<li>Securities market capable of delivering high returns,</li>
<li>Near-universal banking and mobile penetration,</li>
<li>The India Stack infrastructure with Aadhaar for easy eKYC, and UPI for secure digital payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The government, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and the NPS industry now need to urgently put their heads together and address the obvious supply and demand side barriers. Every day is precious. After all, pension exclusion is akin to climate change. It needs immediate attention. By 2050, India’s problem of old age poverty will have become way too large, too late, too expensive and entirely irreversible<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>Nearly 400 million young, economically active Indians are slowly walking towards extreme old age poverty in this context how will you explain and analyse the term old age poverty? Suggest some dynamic measures to address this problem.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>A team of researchers at the IIT — Guwahati has developed an edible coating using marine alga that coated on vegetables and fruits, substantially extends their shelf-life.</p>
<h4>Dunaliella tertiolecta: The Edible coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>The team used a mix of an extract of a marine microalga called Dunaliella tertiolecta and polysaccharides to produce it.</li>
<li>The microalga is known for its antioxidant properties and has various bioactive compounds such as carotenoids and proteins.</li>
<li>It is also used to produce algal oil, a non-animal source of omega-3 fatty acid and is considered a good source of biofuel.</li>
<li>After the oil is extracted, the residue is usually discarded.</li>
<li>The researchers used extracts from this residue in formulating their film, in combination with chitosan, which is a carbohydrate.</li>
<li>It also has antimicrobial and antifungal properties and can be made into an edible film.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of this Edible coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>The films displayed superior antioxidant activity, thermal stability, mechanical strength, total phenolic content and water vapour barrier property.</li>
<li>They also had excellent UV-Vis light-blocking properties.</li>
<li>The researchers also tested the biosafety of these coatings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is it viable?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The new coatings can be mass-produced.</li>
<li>They are very stable to light, heat, and temperature up to 40C, edible, and can be safely eaten as part of the product formulation and do not add unfavourable properties to it.</li>
<li>They retain texture, colour, appearance, flavour and nutritional value.</li>
<li>The material can be either directly coated on the vegetables and fruits or made into a vegetable storage pouch.</li>
<li>In both cases, the shelf-life of the vegetables can be extended.</li>
<li>It is a simple dip coating technique with no significant cost added to the post-harvest processing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Economic significance of Edible coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/agri-research-role-of-icar/">Indian Council of Agricultural Research</a>, between 4.6 and 15.9 per cent of fruits and vegetables go waste post-harvest, partly due to poor storage conditions.</li>
<li>In fact, post-harvest loss in certain produce items like potato, onion, and tomato could even be as high as 19%, which results in high prices for this highly consumed commodity.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Vizhinjam Port Project</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Port-led development in India</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-628741" height="237" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vizhi-300x237.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vizhi-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vizhi.jpg 435w" width="300"/></p>
<p>Vizhinjam near Thiruvananthapuram, is on the boil due to the under-construction Vizhinjam Port Project, from both sea and land.</p>
<h4>Vizhinjam Port Project</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Vizhinjam International Transhipment Deep-water Multipurpose Seaport is an ambitious project taken up by Government of Kerala.</li>
<li>It is designed primarily to cater container transhipment besides multi-purpose and break bulk cargo.</li>
<li>The port is being currently developed in landlord model with a Public Private Partnership component on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer (“DBFOT”) basis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why protests are erupted?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The protestors have been opposing the construction work by the Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited.</li>
<li>Adani group is developing the port on DBFOT basis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What lies at the heart of the protest?</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to fisherfolk, the port work has aggravated the coastal erosion along the coast of Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
<li>A scientific study to assess the impact of the port work on the shoreline has to be conducted urgently by stopping the construction.</li>
<li>Further, around 300 families along the coastline were shifted to relief camps after their houses were destroyed due to high-intensity coastal erosion.</li>
<li>The protesters demand a <strong><u>comprehensive rehabilitation package</u></strong>, an <strong><u>assured minimum wage</u></strong> when the sea turns rough due to inclement weather and subsidised kerosene for boats.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why the Vizhinjam project is considered important?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The port is located on the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula, just 10 nautical miles from the major international sea route and east-west shipping axis.</li>
<li>It has a natural water depth of more than 20 m within a nautical mile from the coast.</li>
<li>The Vizhinjam port is likely to play a pivotal role in the maritime development of the country and Kerala.</li>
<li>The commissioning of the port is expected to leverage the growth of 17 minor ports in the State along with creating thousands of employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NDPS Act</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Issues with NDPS Act</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-500883" height="683" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ndps-195x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ndps-195x300.jpg 195w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ndps.jpg 658w" width="444"/></p>
<p>While granting bail to a man arrested on June 1 for possessing 29 kg of bhang and 400 g of ganja, Karnataka High Court recently observed that nowhere in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act is bhang referred to as a prohibited drink or prohibited drug.</p>
<h4>What is Bhang?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bhang is the edible preparation made from the leaves of the cannabis plant, often incorporated into drinks such as thandai and lassi, along with various foods.</li>
<li>Bhang has been consumed in the Indian subcontinent for centuries, and is frequently consumed during the festivals of Holi and Mahashivratri.</li>
<li>Its widespread use caught the attention of Europeans, with Garcia da Orta, a Portuguese physician who arrived in Goa in the 16th century, noting that, “Bhang is so generally used and by such a number of people that there is no mystery about it”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bhang and the law</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enacted in 1985, the NDPS Act is the main legislation that deals with drugs and their trafficking.</li>
<li>Various provisions of the Act punish production, manufacture, sale, possession, consumption, purchase, transport, and use of banned drugs, except for medical and scientific purposes.</li>
<li>The NDPS Act defines cannabis (hemp) as a narcotic drug based on the parts of the plant that come under its purview. The Act lists these parts as:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Charas: “The separated resin, in whatever form, whether crude or purified, obtained from the cannabis plant and also includes concentrated preparation and resin known as hashish oil or liquid hashish.”</li>
<li>Ganja: “The flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops), by whatever name they be known or designated.”</li>
<li>“Any mixture, with or without any neutral material, of any of the above forms of cannabis or any drink prepared therefrom.”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The Act, in its definition, excludes seeds and leaves “when not accompanied by the tops”.</li>
<li>Bhang, which is made with the leaves of the plant, is not mentioned in the NDPS Act.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cannabis and criminal liability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Section 20 of the NDPS Act lays out the punishment for the production, manufacture, sale, purchase, import and inter-state export of cannabis, as defined in the Act.</li>
<li>The prescribed punishment is based on the amount of drugs seized.</li>
<li>Contravention that involves a small quantity (100 g of charas/hashish or 1 kg of ganja), will result in rigorous imprisonment for a term that may extend to one year and/or a fine which may extend to Rs 10,000.</li>
<li>For a commercial quantity (1 kg charas/ hashish or 20 kg ganja), rigorous imprisonment of not less than 10 years, which may extend to 20 years, including a fine that is not less than Rs 1,00,000 but may extend to Rs 2,00,000.</li>
<li>Where the contravention involves quantity less than commercial, but greater than small quantity, rigorous imprisonment up to 10 years is prescribed, along with a fine which may extend to Rs 1,00,000.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Alcohol laws</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The most ambitious Delhi’s Alcohol Policy 2021-22 which brought in big discounts for consumers was scrapped on July 31 amid allegations of corruption and irregularities in the drafting and implementation of the policy.</p>
<p>After scrapping the new policy, the Delhi government decided to bring back the ‘<strong><u>old excise regime</u></strong>’ that was in force before.</p>
<blockquote><p>Definitely! We shall not nit-pick the old vs. new policy. Let us generally understand how alcohol is regulated in India.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Alcohol laws of India: A backgrounder</h4>
<ul>
<li>The legal drinking age in India and the laws which regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol vary significantly from state to state.</li>
<li>In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar, Gujarat, Nagaland and Mizoram.</li>
<li>There is partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur.</li>
<li>All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but fix a legal drinking age, which ranges at different ages per region.</li>
<li>In some states the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Regulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol is a subject in the <strong><u>State List</u></strong> under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.</li>
<li>Therefore, the <strong><u>laws governing alcohol vary from state to state</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Liquor in India is generally sold at liquor stores, restaurants, hotels, bars, pubs, clubs and discos but not online.</li>
<li>Some states, like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, prohibit private parties from owning liquor stores making the state government the sole retailer of alcohol in those states.</li>
<li>In some states, liquor may be sold at groceries, departmental stores, banquet halls and/or farm houses.</li>
<li>Some tourist areas have special laws allowing the sale of alcohol on beaches and houseboats.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Drunk driving law</h4>
<ul>
<li>The blood alcohol content (BAC) legal limit is 0.03% or 0.03 mg alcohol in 100 ml blood.</li>
<li>On 1 March 2012, the Union Cabinet approved proposed changes to the Motor Vehicle Act.</li>
<li>Higher penalties were introduced, including fines from ₹2,000 to ₹10,000 and imprisonment from 6 months to 4 years.</li>
<li>Different penalties are assessed depending on the blood alcohol content at the time of the offence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dry days</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dry days are specific days when the sale of alcohol is not permitted.</li>
<li>Most of the Indian states observe these days on major national festivals/occasions such as Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti (2 October).</li>
<li>Dry days are also observed during elections in India.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Taxation on Alcohol</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most states levy either Value added Tax (VAT) or Excise duty or both.</li>
<li>Excise duty is a tax levied to discourage the consumption of a product.</li>
<li>It is calculated on a per-unit basis. Meaning, if you buy 1 litre of liquor, you pay a fixed excise duty of Rs 15.</li>
<li>Value-added Tax is charged in the proportion of the product. If a bottle costs Rs 100, and the state levies 10 percent VAT, the price rises to Rs 110.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tax rates in States</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 29 states/UTs in India approach liquor taxation differently.</li>
<li>For instance, Gujarat has banned its citizens from consuming liquor since 1961.</li>
<li>But outsiders with special licenses can still buy.</li>
<li>Puducherry, on the other hand, earns most of its revenue from alcohol trading.</li>
<li>Bihar has prohibited alcohol consumption entirely, meaning the state’s revenue from liquor consumption is nil.</li>
<li>Its neighbour, Uttar Pradesh, earns the most excise duty on liquor.</li>
<li>The state does not levy VAT but a special duty on liquor, collecting funds for particular purposes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Do you know?</strong></h4>
<p>Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu consume as much as 45 percent of the liquor sold in the country.</p>
<p>Nationally, Maharashtra charges the highest rate but draws only a portion of its revenue from its sales.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Why alcohol isn’t banned everywhere?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taxes from alcohol sales roughly form a quarter of state revenues.</li>
<li>If this stream suddenly stops, states have to compulsorily cut some important spending.</li>
<li>Also, moderate alcohol consumption may provide some health benefits.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Despite all the public talk of the importance of conserving our national heritage, the budget of the ASI, the primary institutional guardian of monuments, in 2021-22 has been reduced by more than Rs 200 cr.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How do you define heritage?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Heritage is the full range of our inherited traditions, monuments, objects, and culture. Most important, it is the range of contemporary activities, meanings, and behaviours that we draw from them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Threats to Indian Heritage</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theft:</strong> The incidents of thefts have been observed usually from unprotected monuments, ancient temples. The thefts cases have also been seen in the protected monuments and museums as well. It is due to negligence of security guards in museums, monuments etc.</li>
<li><strong>Smuggling</strong>: illicit traffic and smuggling in antiquities. Illicit traffic is motivated often by profit and sometimes by the demand for luxuries.</li>
<li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Unregulated tourism, tourist activities run by touts, private agents have affected the art heritage places. The Culture Ministry of India has reported that up to 24 Indian monuments have been declared “untraceable” or “missing” by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).</li>
<li><strong>Issues with security of museums</strong>: Most of the museums are poorly guarded due to shortage of manpower leading to theft of artifacts, fire accidents etc.</li>
<li><strong>Duplication</strong>: Fakes paintings and art forms leading to threat to livelihoods of artists.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Maintenance</strong>: The state of the wall paintings in Ajanta caves is continuously getting worse, which can be attributed to humidity as well as to a lack of care.</li>
<li><strong>Encroachment on monuments</strong>: Another miss from the ministry has been encroachments of monuments. Over 278 centrally protected monuments have been encroached upon or have illegal occupants, as per government data.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="heritage " class="alignnone wp-image-628759" height="285" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-10-300x208.webp" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-10-300x208.webp 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-10.webp 630w" width="411"/>Why should we protect our heritage?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of human consciousness is a continuous process</strong>: History here serves as a laboratory and the past serves as a demarcation to understand the regional laws and social structures. This understanding helps in our progress towards an ideal society.</li>
<li><strong>Pride of country</strong>: The art heritage is the identity and pride of our country. It is duty of every citizen to protect, preserve and perpetuate the cultural richness.</li>
<li><strong>Tourism potential</strong>: for art monuments and museums is very high. Tourism generates revenue for the state as well as private artists due to the money-multiplier quality.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure development:</strong> takes place in and around the areas. Eg. Hampi despite being a small town has excellent infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs:</strong> It creates jobs for a lot of people from art industry and tourism industry as well</li>
<li><strong>Sense of belonging</strong>: It creates a feeling of oneness and a sense of attachment by enhancing a sense of belonging to a culture or a region.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen conviction</strong>: Every historical site has an important story to tell and these stories have inspired many people to strengthen their convictions and commitment to fight injustice and oppression.</li>
<li><strong>Soft power</strong>: Art and culture is also a part of soft power in world politics.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>About Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ASI is an attached office of the Ministry of Culture.</li>
<li>It was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director-General.</li>
<li>Under the provisions of the AMASR Act of 1958, the ASI administers more than 3650 ancient monuments, archaeological sites and remains of national importance.</li>
<li>These can include everything from temples, mosques, churches, tombs, and cemeteries to palaces, forts, step-wells, and rock-cut caves.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Initiatives by ASI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Museums: </strong>ASI’s museums are customarily located right next to the sites that their inventories are associated with “so that they may be studied amid their natural surroundings and not lose focus by being transported”. A dedicated Museums Branch maintains a total of 44 museums spread across the country.</li>
<li><strong>Publications by ASI: </strong>Epigraphia Indica, Ancient India, Indian Archaeology: A Review (Annually).</li>
<li><strong>Library</strong>: <strong>Central Archaeological Library </strong>in the <strong>National Archives building</strong> in Janpath, New Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Issues and Challenges ahead of ASI </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>To restore or not: </strong>Issue is that technically speaking- ruins are seldom “restored” in original state. This is because in absence of documentation- archaeologists are left to conjecture what buildings may have looked like when they were originally built.</li>
<li><strong>Personnel Management Issues: </strong>Higher Authorities of ASI are traditionally from IAS Cadre<strong>. </strong>In-house specialist must be promoted for better coordination b/w technical and managerial aspects of restoration</li>
<li><strong>Issues explored in CAG Report: </strong>92 monuments are untraceable with no database on artifacts<strong>. </strong>Poor Documentation of Protected Monuments/Artifacts<strong>. </strong>Paucity of funds (Eg- Red fort gardens lie unkempt).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is the duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture. Preservation and conservation of India’s rich cultural heritage and promotion of all forms of art and culture, both tangible and intangible, is essential and assumes a lot of importance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong><strong> Safeguarding the Indian heritage is the need of the moment.</strong> <strong>What are the challenges faced in safeguarding them? What steps would you suggest to protect them?</strong></p>

<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The country’s move is a departure from the norm and is been seen as an attempt to appease China.</li>
<li>This raises concerns about China’s growing influence in the country and the region at large.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where is the Solomon Islands located?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania, to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu.</li>
<li>Its capital, Honiara, is located on the largest island, Guadalcanal.</li>
<li>It is part of the ethnically Melanesian group of islands in the Pacific and lies between Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.</li>
<li>The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (a part of Papua New Guinea).</li>
<li>It excludes outlying islands, such as the Santa Cruz Islands and Rennell and Bellona.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quick recap of its past</h4>
<ul>
<li>The islands, which were initially controlled by the British Empire during the colonial era, went through the hands of Germany and Japan.</li>
<li>It then went back to the UK after the Americans took over the islands from the Japanese during World War II.</li>
<li>The islands became independent in 1978 to become a constitutional monarchy under the British Crown, with a parliamentary system of government.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, its inability to manage domestic ethnic conflicts led to close security relations with Australia, which is the traditional first responder to any crisis in the South Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did China enter the picture?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Earlier this year, the Solomon Islands established a <strong><u>security agreement with China</u></strong>, saying it needed Beijing’s assistance with its domestic security situation.</li>
<li>But the <strong><u>announcement had rattled the west</u></strong>, esp. the US, Australia and others in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
<li>The concerns were that the agreement could potentially lead to a <strong><u>Chinese military base on the island nation</u></strong> and a gain in power-projection capabilities.</li>
<li>At that time, following intense scrutiny, the Solomon Islands had <strong><u>denied</u></strong> that the agreement would allow China to establish a naval base.</li>
<li>The Island insisted that the agreement was only to <strong><u>assist the Solomon Islands with what he called “hard internal threats”.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the Solomon Islands’ stance?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The government has asked all partner countries with plans to conduct naval visits or patrols to put them on hold until a <strong><u>revised national mechanism</u></strong> is in place.</li>
<li>The revised national mechanism <strong><u>applied to all foreign vessels seeking access to the country’s ports</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The nation wanted to <strong><u>build up its</u></strong> <strong><u>own naval capacity</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It has some <strong><u>unfortunate experiences of foreign naval vessels entering its waters</u></strong> without any diplomatic clearance.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is behind China’s growing influence in the region?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is no dispute that China has been rapidly increasing its presence and influence in the region for over three decades, particularly in the South Pacific.</li>
<li>Certainly Beijing views the Pacific Island region as an <strong><u>important component of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). </u></strong></li>
<li>Specifically, it sees the region as a critical air freight hub in its so-called <strong><u>Air Silk Road</u></strong>, which connects Asia with Central and South America.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Concerns of the West</h4>
<ul>
<li>The United States and its regional allies, such as Australia and New Zealand, are concerned that the China-Solomon Islands security pact allows Chinese naval vessels to replenish there.</li>
<li>That could open the <strong><u>door to a Chinese naval base</u></strong>, which would significantly extend China’s military reach in the South Pacific.”</li>
<li>It is likely that this security agreement between China and the Solomon Islands has been driven by, what the CFR calls, Beijing’s “<strong><u>sense of vulnerability</u></strong>” in the region.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the rationale for the Solomon Islands’ increasing proximity to China?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Solomon Islands had cultivated strong ties with Taiwan, which ended with the emergence of the current government in Honiara.</li>
<li>In 2019, the regime change switched Taiwan for China.</li>
<li>This was supposedly after Beijing offered half a billion US dollars in financial aid, roughly five times what Taiwan spent on the islands in the past two decades.</li>
<li>It has been alleged by the pro-Taiwan Opposition that the incumbent government has been bribed by China.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is China interested in the Solomon Islands?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolating Taiwan:</strong> The Solomon Islands was one among the six Pacific island states which had official bilateral relations with Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Supporter in UN:</strong> The small Pacific island states act as potential vote banks for mobilising support for the great powers in international fora like the United Nations.</li>
<li><strong>Larger EEZ:</strong> These states have disproportionately large maritime Exclusive Economic Zones when compared to their small sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Natural resources:</strong> Solomon Islands, in particular, have significant reserves of timber and mineral resources, along with fisheries.</li>
<li><strong>Countering US:</strong> But more importantly, they are strategically located for China to insert itself between America’s military bases in the Pacific islands and Australia.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What does this mean for the established geopolitical configuration in the region?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diminishing western influence:</strong> The Pacific islands, in the post-World War II scenario, were exclusively under the spheres of influence of the Western powers, in particular, the US, UK, France and Australia and New Zealand.</li>
<li><strong>Inserting into western hegemony:</strong> All of them have territorial possessions in the region, with the three nuclear powers among them having used the region as a nuclear weapons testing ground.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting of dependencies:</strong> The smaller island nations of the region are heavily dependent on them, especially Australia as it is a resident power.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Damage control by West</h4>
<ul>
<li>Australia has reacted with boosted finances, and by extending its current security mission till 2023 when the islands will host the Pacific Games.</li>
<li>The US has responded by considering reopening its embassy in Honiara after a long 29-year gap.</li>
<li>New Zealand has shed its typical restraint about China and has criticised it for attempting to militarise the Pacific islands.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>particulars of the bill</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>electricity reforms</p></div></div><h4><strong><img alt="electricity" class="alignnone wp-image-629013" height="343" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/download.jpeg" width="558"/>Context </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Concerns of states on some provisions of the new Electricity Bill are justified. But the legislation proposes welcome correctives to longstanding problems of the power sector.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Important provisions of the bill</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payment security</strong>: The Bill provides that electricity will not be scheduled or despatched if adequate payment security is not provided by the discom.   The central government may prescribe rules regarding payment security.</li>
<li><strong>Contract enforcement</strong>: The Bill empowers the CERC and SERCs to adjudicate disputes related to the performance of contracts.  These refer to contracts related to the sale, purchase, or transmission of electricity.  Further, the Commissions will have powers of a Civil Court.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable purchase obligation</strong>: The Act empowers SERCs to specify renewable purchase obligations (RPO) for discoms.  RPO refers to the mandate to procure a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources.  The Bill adds that RPO should not be below a minimum percentage prescribed by the central government.  Failure to meet RPO will be punishable with a penalty between 25 paise and 50 paise per kilowatt of the shortfall.</li>
<li><strong>Selection committee for SERCs</strong>: Under the Act, the Chairperson of the Central Electricity Authority or the Chairperson of the CERC is one of the members of the selection committee to recommend appointments to the SERCs.  Under the Bill, instead of this person, the central government will nominate a member to the selection committee.  The nominee should not be below the rank of Additional Secretary to the central government.</li>
<li><strong>Composition of Commissions and APTEL</strong>: The Bill increases the number of members (including the chairperson) in SERCs from three to four.  Further, at least one member in both the CERC and SERCs must be from law background.  Under the Act, Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) consists of a chairperson and three other members.  The Bill instead provides that the APTEL will have three or more members, as may be prescribed by the central government.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>State apprehensions of the bill </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi state license: </strong>The clause pertaining to applicants seeking a distribution licence in more than one state. It states that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), and not the SERC, will grant the licence. This is problematic because a SERC is likely to be more aware of the field-level conditions in a state than its central counterpart.</li>
<li><strong>Centre can bypass state: </strong>The Bill has a provision empowering the Centre to give directions directly to the SERCs. Till now, the CERC received instructions from the Centre and the SERCs were under the state. The new Bill enables the Centre to bypass state governments. It’s not surprising that this is a matter of concern for the states.</li>
<li><strong>Direct appointment by centre:</strong> The Bill states that the SERC chairperson will now be a nominee of the central government and will be an additional secretary-level official. This gives the impression that the Centre is trying to control the appointments to the SERCs<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/power-sector-reforms/"><strong>Why the bill is important? </strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compensation clause: </strong>The Bill states that if power purchase agreement PPAs are renegotiated, the affected party has to be compensated within 90 days from the date of submission of the petition.</li>
<li><strong>Uniformity in tariffs revision:</strong> New tariffs have to be made applicable from the beginning of the financial year. New tariffs often come into force in the middle of the financial year (due to delays in the issuing of orders by SERCs). This means that discoms do not earn their full revenues leading to cash flow problems.</li>
<li><strong>Easy tariff petition processing now:</strong> The Bill has proposed a reduction in the time for processing tariff petitions from 120 days to 90 days.</li>
<li><strong>Suo moto jurisdiction</strong>: Regulatory commissions have been given suo motu jurisdiction if tariff petitions are not filed within 30 days of the stipulated time. This too is a step in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>More teeth to load dispatcher: </strong>the Bill proposes to give more teeth to the national load dispatcher. We need to strengthen the load dispatcher for the smooth functioning of the grid, especially with a huge renewable capacity where intermittency of generation is a major issue in the offing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The rollout of the proposed amendments through a consensus-based approach would go a long way in overhauling the weakest link in the nation’s power supply chain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Electricity Bill 2022 is a remedy worse than the disease afflicting India’s power sector. Critically analyse.</strong></p></blockquote>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Cervavac, Cervical cancer</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Menstrual hygiene and related diseases</p></div></div><p><img alt="Cervavax" class="alignnone wp-image-629407" height="271" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cervavac-300x175.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cervavac-300x175.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cervavac.jpg 645w" width="465"/></p>
<p>Union Minister of Science and Technology has announced the scientific completion of Cervavac, India’s first indigenously developed quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer.</p>
<h4>What is Cervavac?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cervavac was developed by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India in coordination with the Department of Biotechnology (DBT).</li>
<li>The project to develop the vaccine was implemented by the then secretary of the DBT, Dr. M K Bhan in 2011.</li>
<li>Since then, 30 meetings of scientific advisory groups and site visits conducted by DBT have helped review the scientific merit of the entire journey to develop the vaccine.</li>
<li>Cervavac received market authorisation approval from the Drug Controller General of India on July 12 this year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is so unique about Cervavac?</h4>
<ul>
<li>HPV vaccines are given in two doses and data has shown that the antibodies that develop after both are administered can last up to six or seven years.</li>
<li>Unlike Covid vaccines, booster shots may not be required for the cervical cancer vaccine.</li>
<li>Until now, the HPV vaccines available in India were produced by foreign manufacturers at an approximate cost of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,500 per dose.</li>
<li>Cervavac is likely to be significantly cheaper, slated to cost approximately Rs 200 to 400.</li>
<li>It has also demonstrated a robust antibody response that is nearly 1,000 times higher than the baseline against all targeted HPV types and in all dose and age groups.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Significance of the vaccine</h4>
<ul>
<li>Despite being largely preventable, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally, according to the WHO.</li>
<li>In 2018, an estimated 57000 women were diagnosed with the disease and it accounted for 311,000 deaths across the world.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How common is cervical cancer in India?</h4>
<ul>
<li>India accounts for about a fifth of the global burden of cervical cancer, with 1.23 lakh cases and around 67,000 deaths per year.</li>
<li>Almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), a common virus that is transmitted through sexual contact.</li>
<li>The body’s immune system usually gets rid of the HPV infection naturally within two years.</li>
<li>However, in a small percentage of people, the virus can linger over time and turn some normal cells into abnormal cells and then cancer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How dangerous is cervical cancer?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cervical cancer is preventable if detected early and managed effectively.</li>
<li>Screening and vaccination are two powerful tools that are available for preventing cervical cancer.</li>
<li>Still, there is little awareness among women about the prevention of this cancer and less than 10% of Indian women get screened.</li>
<li>All women aged 30-49 must get screened for cervical cancer even if they have no symptoms and get their adolescent daughters vaccinated with the HPV vaccine.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the challenges?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The biggest task will be in allocating adequate resources and manpower for vaccinating the massive demographic of adolescent girls aged between 9 and 15, to ensure that they are protected from HPV early.</li>
<li>There is a huge need for stepping up awareness about the disease and the vaccine in the community.</li>
<li>Unlike Covid and the vaccination programme, there is very little awareness about cervical cancer.</li>
<li>Overall awareness and screening are very low in the community and that is a concern.</li>
<li>Since this is a preventable disease and hence a huge awareness programme is required</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>School-based vaccination programmes might work effectively.</li>
<li>Currently, none exist and therefore planning will have to be done along those lines.</li>
<li>Those accessing public health programmes will get the vaccine free of cost at government-aided schools.</li>
<li>However concerted efforts will have to be made to ensure the involvement of private healthcare facilities and NGOs towards an effective rollout.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In the recent few years, the growth of the economy and urbanization have accelerated. Rapid unplanned urbanization has put extreme pressure on natural resources.</li>
<li>Unplanned urbanization, however, exerts great strain on our cities. In fact, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the dire need for the planning and management of our cities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does urban planning mean?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Urban planning, also known as regional planning, town planning, city planning is a technical and political process that is focused on the development and design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks and their accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are ‘Happy Cities’?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A term that follows the Green City, Sustainable City, Liveable City, in the lingo of urban planning</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is a smart city?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A smart city is one that uses information and communication technologies to enhance citizen engagement. It is a neo-vision which seeks to improve the delivery of services in urban areas. The following story maps out the steps being taken by India to explore this concept in practice.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the Smart Cities Mission?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable cities</strong>: The Smart Cities Mission aims at developing 100 cities, which were shortlisted, into self-sustainable urban settlements.</li>
<li><strong>Chronology</strong>: The mission was launched on June 25, 2015 and was projected as one aimed at transforming the process of urban development in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive revamp</strong>: Among its strategic components is ‘area-based development’, which includes city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (Greenfield development), plus a pan-city initiative in which ‘smart solutions’ are applied covering larger parts of the city.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fast Facts – Urbanization in India</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most Urbanized States: Tamil Nadu 43.9%; Maharashtra 4%; Gujarat  37.4%</li>
<li>3 out of world’s 21 mega cities: Mumbai (19 mill); Delhi (15 mill); Kolkata (14 mill)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Urban planning" class="alignnone wp-image-629341" height="216" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/84-300x126.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/84-300x126.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/84.jpg 450w" width="514"/>Urban planning challenges </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many urban governments lack a modern planning framework</li>
<li>The multiplicity of local bodies obstructs efficient planning and land use</li>
<li>Rigid master plans and restrictive zoning regulations limit the land available for building, constricting cities’ abilities to grow in accordance with changing needs<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Housing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building regulations that limit urban density – such as floor space indexes – reduce the number of houses available, thereby pushing up property prices</li>
<li>Outdated rent control regulations reduce the number of houses available on rent – a critical option for the poor</li>
<li>Policy, planning, and regulation deficiencies lead to a proliferation of slums</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Service delivery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a strong bias towards adding physical infrastructure rather than providing financially and environmentally sustainable services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most urban bodies do not generate the revenues needed to renew infrastructure, nor do they have the creditworthiness to access capital markets for funds</li>
<li>Urban transport planning needs to be more holistic – there is a focus on moving vehicles rather than meeting the needs of the large numbers of people who walk or ride bicycles in India’s towns and cities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Demystifying Planning and Involving Citizens: </strong>While it is important to maintain the master plans’ technical rigour, it is equally important to demystify them for enabling citizens’ participation at relevant stages. Therefore, the committee strongly recommends a ‘Citizen Outreach Campaign’ for demystifying urban planning.</li>
<li><strong>Steps for Enhancing the Role of Private Sector: </strong>The report recommends that concerted measures must be taken at multiple levels to strengthen the role of the private sector to improve the overall planning capacity in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Revision of Town and Country Planning Acts: </strong>Most States have enacted the Town and Country Planning acts, that enable them to prepare and notify master plans for implementation. However, many need to be reviewed and upgraded.</li>

<ul>
<li>According to available UNESCO data on some selected countries, India is at the lowest position, having only 14% female researchers working in STEM areas highlighting the presence of glass ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is glass ceiling? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A glass ceiling is a metaphor used to represent an invisible barrier that prevents women from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. The metaphor was first coined by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What Is a Gender-equal Society?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A society in which both women and men shall be given equal opportunities to participate voluntarily in activities in all fields as equal partners, and be able to enjoy political, economic, social and cultural benefits equally as well as to share responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How glass ceiling limits women progress?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Few opportunities</strong>: Due to deep-rooted biases, it is difficult for women to access many experiences and networks that are easily accessible to men.</li>
<li><strong>Social barriers and gender norms</strong>: Personal barriers include notions of compromise and sacrifice that are ingrained in women. This feeds into how women present themselves. External barriers and cultural cues reinforce how men and women “ought” to behave.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Inequity</strong>: Stereotypes related to gender brilliance or gender-based intrinsic aptitude generate inequity which remains unnoticed.</li>
<li><strong>Low self-confidence</strong>: Our socio-cultural constructs reflect absolute patriarchy causing even women to be sceptical about their abilities, to accept the roles set for them in the household.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Around the world, finding a job is much tougher for women than it is for men. When women are employed, they tend to work in low-quality jobs in vulnerable conditions, and there is little improvement forecast in the near future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and refers to any subjects that fall under these four disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are the drivers at policy and programme level to promote women in STEM in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Breaking myths and stereotypes around STEM is crucial to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 (gender equality) which includes women’s use of enabling technology, including ICT as a means of achieving economic empowerment and greater agency and also many other STEM-related SDGs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="glass ceiling" class="alignnone wp-image-629353" height="267" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B-300x176.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B-300x176.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B-768x450.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B.jpg 1000w" width="456"/>Government initiatives </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>GATI: </strong>It will be called GATI (Gender Advancement through Transforming Institutions). The DST is incorporating a system of grading institutes depending on the enrolment of women and the advancement of the careers of women faculty and scientists.</li>
<li><strong>CURIE</strong>: For infrastructure in women’s universities</li>
<li><strong>Vigyan Jyoti Scheme</strong>: Encourage girls in high school to pursue STEM</li>
<li><strong>The Athena Swan Charter: </strong>is a framework which is used across the globe to support and transform gender equality within higher education (HE) and research.</li>
<li><strong>KIRAN</strong>: (Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through nurturing) Scheme to encourage women Scientists</li>
<li><strong>Indo-US Fellowship:</strong> for Women in STEMM (STEM and Medicine)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Gender equality or parity will happen only when there is a change in mind-set and institutions consider women as assets rather than simply a diversity rectification issue. Policies that help women advance in science and society globally are needed. The world cannot afford to miss out on what women have to offer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new Naval Ensign (flag), which will be unveiled by PM in Kochi, has brought into focus the flags and ranks adopted by the Indian military after Independence.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Do you know?</strong></p>
<p>The octagonal shape with twin golden borders draws inspiration from the seal of the great Indian emperor, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, whose visionary maritime outlook established a credible naval fleet</p></blockquote>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Documents accessed from <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/pib-national-archives-of-india/">National Archives of India</a> show that Lord Mountbatten, former Viceroy and Governor General of India, played a major role in suggesting new flags and rank badges.</li>
<li>This was when India was about to become a Republic on January 26, 1950.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When did India switch from British-era flags and ranks?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The switch from British-era flags and ranks took place when India became a Republic (26<sup>th</sup> Jan, 1950).</li>
<li>Prior to that the flags and badges of ranks of the military were of the British pattern.</li>
<li>The new, Indian pattern of flags of Army, Navy and Air Force, and also the Regimental Flags of the Army and badges of ranks of all three services were adopted on January 26, 1950.</li>
<li>The ‘Kings Commission’ granted to Indian military officers was also changed to ‘Indian Commission’ on the same date.</li>
<li>And at a subsequent date the King’s Colours of the various Regiments were laid to rest in Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When did Lord Mountbatten come into the picture?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The national archives have files, dated 1949, that include a detailed note from Lord Mountbatten regarding names, flags and ranks of the armed forces, and then PM Nehru’s letter to the then Defence Minister Baldev Singh regarding Mountbatten’s suggestions.</li>
<li>The note, archives reveal, was given to Nehru by Lord Mountbatten when the two met in London.</li>
<li>The note was forwarded from the PM’s office to the office of then Governor General C Rajagopalachari on May 24, 1949, stating that it is on the issue of ‘Names and Insignia of Indian Armed Forces’ after India becomes a Republic.</li>
<li>The letter also stated that the note should be placed before the Governor General.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What did Lord Mountbatten say in the note?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The note begins by saying that consequent to becoming a Republic the word ‘Royal’ shall be dropped from India’s Army, Navy and Air Force.</li>
<li>Mountbatten strongly recommended that no other word like ‘State’ of ‘Republican’ should replace the word ‘Royal’.</li>
<li>This was because it would have the effect of separating the forces of India psychologically from the other services in the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>He further suggested in the letter that the Crown should be replaced from the insignias and replaced by the “three lions of Ashoka”.</li>
<li>Regarding the Naval Ensign, he said that all Commonwealth navies fly the same flag which consists of a large white flag with a red-cross and Union Jack in the upper corner nearer the staff and is known as the ‘White Ensign’.</li>
<li>The new Ensign, the note suggested, should continue to have the red-cross but the Indian national flag should replace the Union Jack.</li>
<li>He suggested this to maintain commonality with the Commonwealth flags.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What changes did Mountbatten suggest for uniforms?</h4>
<ul>
<li>He strongly urged that existing uniforms should be changed as little as possible.</li>
<li>He added that the Crown worn on badges of ranks of Majors and above should be replaced by the “three lions of Ashoka”.</li>
<li>The Star of the Order of the Bath should be replaced by Star of India or another form of star.</li>
<li>He also suggested that the crossed sword and baton on the badges of ranks of Generals should be retained.</li>
<li>The former Viceroy advocated retaining the stripes of rank in Navy and Air Force saying these were internationally almost the same.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did the Indian government react to Mountbatten’s suggestions?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nehru wrote to the then defence minister in September 1949 saying that he agreed with the suggestions made by the former Governor General that there should be as little change as possible.</li>
<li>The then PM particularly mentioned the changes suggested by Mountbatten for the Navy.</li>
<li>Then Governor General C Rajagopalachari also wrote back to Nehru in May 1949 itself agreeing to Mountbatten’s suggestions.</li>
<li>In the end, Mountbatten’s suggestions were virtually all accepted and implemented with effect from January 26, 1950.</li>
</ul>

<p>A little more than six decades ago, Tibetan Democracy Day was marked with the inauguration of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala on September 2.</p>
<h4>Tibetan Democracy Day</h4>
<ul>
<li>In February 1960, a little less than a year after he crossed over into India, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama outlined in Bodh Gaya, where The Buddha attained Enlightenment, a detailed program of democratic practice for exiled Tibetans.</li>
<li>According to the website of the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile (TPiE), he advised them to set up an elected body with three exiled representatives each from the three provinces, and one each from the four religious schools of Tibetan Buddhism.</li>
<li>After elections were held, 13 elected representatives, called ‘Deputies’, were designated as the ‘Commission of Tibetan People’s Deputies’ (CTPD). They took oath on September 2, 1960.</li>
<li>Subsequently from 1975 onward, this date began to be formally observed as Tibetan Democracy Day.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Parliament-in-Exile</h4>
<ul>
<li>The TPiE is the highest legislative body of the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/centre-extends-relief-to-tibetan-committee-by-5-years/">Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).</a></li>
<li>It is described as one of the three pillars of Tibetan democratic governance — the others being the Judiciary and the Kashag, or Executive.</li>
<li>The website of the TPiE underlines the Dalai Lama’s commitment to the democratic principle — it quotes the Dalai Lama from the Foreword to the Constitution for Tibet, drafted in 1963:</li>
<li>The CTA is based in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh.</li>
<li>Elections are held every five years to elect Members of the TPiE, and their Sikyong (Prime Minister). The 16th TPiE was elected in 2016.</li>
<li>This was the second direct election after the Dalai Lama distanced himself from the political functioning of the TPiE in 2011.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Government-in-Exile</h4>
<ul>
<li>On March 10, 1963, the Dalai Lama promulgated the Constitution of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile (TGiE).</li>
<li>From 1991 onwards, TPiE became the legislative organ of the CTA, the Tibetan Supreme Justice Commission became the judicial organ, and the Kashag the executive organ.</li>
<li>The TGiE is not recognised officially by any country, including India.</li>
<li>However, many countries, including the US, deal directly with the Sikyong and other Tibetan leaders through various forums.</li>
<li>The TPiE says its democratically elected character helps it manage Tibetan affairs, and raise the Tibetan issue across the world.</li>
<li>The current Sikyong (known as Kalön Tripa until 2012) of the CTA is Lobsang Sangay, who has been the head of the Kashag or Cabinet (first as Kalön Tripa and then as Sikyong) since 2011.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is India’s official policy towards the CTA?</h4>
<ul>
<li>India considers the Dalai Lama as a revered religious leader and an honored guest, but it does not encourage political activities by Tibetans.</li>
<li>It does not recognize any separate government of Tibet functioning in India.</li>
</ul>

<p>In what may be termed as an uncommon ocean phenomenon, the prevailing La Nina conditions over the equatorial Pacific Ocean have entered the third consecutive year.</p>
<h4>What is the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/is-la-nina-a-fair-weather-friend-of-our-country/">La Nina</a> phase has been prevailing since September 2020.</li>
<li>Since the 1950s, La Nina lasting for more than two years has been recorded only on six instances (see graph below), data by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated.</li>
<li>It confirmed that India’s La Nina conditions are here to stay till the end of 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is El Nino and La Nina?</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-356942" height="216" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/enso-300x133.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/enso-300x133.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/enso.jpg 708w" width="487"/></p>
<ul>
<li>While El Nino (Spanish for ‘little boy’), the more common expression, is the abnormal surface warming observed along the eastern and central regions of the Pacific Ocean (the region between Peru and Papua New Guinea).</li>
<li>The La Nina (Spanish for ‘little girl’) is an abnormal cooling of these surface waters.</li>
<li>Together, the El Nino (Warm Phase) and La Nina (Cool Phase) phenomena are termed as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</li>
<li>These are large-scale ocean phenomena that influence the global weather — winds, temperature and rainfall. They have the ability to trigger extreme weather events like droughts, floods, hot and cold conditions, globally.</li>
<li>Each cycle can last anywhere between 9 to 12 months, at times extendable to 18 months — and re-occur after every three to five years.</li>
<li>Meteorologists record the sea surface temperatures for four different regions, known as Nino regions, along this equatorial belt.</li>
<li>Depending on the temperatures, they forecast either as an El Nino, an ENSO neutral phase, or a La Nina.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why has La Nina conditions continued for 3 years?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is surprising that it has continued for the last three years. It may be good for India but not for some other countries.</li>
<li>Under <strong><u>climate change conditions</u></strong>, one must expect more such instances. Climate change could be a factor driving such anomalous conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with La Nina</h4>
<ul>
<li>La Nina years are infamous for <strong><u>frequent and intense hurricanes and cyclones</u></strong> in the Atlantic Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.</li>
<li>Chances of more cyclones are likely due to multiple aiding factors, including <strong><u>high relative moisture and relative low wind shear over the Bay of Bengal.</u></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The UN accused China of serious human rights violations that may amount to “crimes against humanity” in a report examining a crackdown on Uighurs and other ethnic groups.</p>
<h4>What is the leak about?</h4>
<ul>
<li>After initially denying their existence, Beijing has claimed the facilities are vocational training schools, attended voluntarily and aimed at stamping out religious extremism.</li>
<li>But the leaked documents give an insight into how leaders saw the minority population as a security threat.</li>
<li>Photos appear to show officers restraining hooded and shackled inmates with batons, while other guards wearing camouflage stand by with firearms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who are the Uighurs?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are about 12 million Uighurs, mostly Muslim, living in north-western China in the region of Xinjiang, officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).</li>
<li>The Uighurs speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations.</li>
<li>They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.</li>
<li>In recent decades, there’s been a mass migration of Han Chinese (China’s ethnic majority) to Xinjiang, and the Uighurs feel their culture and livelihoods are under threat.</li>
<li>In the early 20th Century, the Uighurs briefly declared independence, but the region was brought under complete control of mainland China’s new Communist government in 1949.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where is Xinjiang?</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-395897" height="374" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xing.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xing.jpg 456w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xing-300x246.jpg 300w" width="456"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Xinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country’s biggest region.</li>
<li>Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning – in theory – it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both face major restrictions by the central government.</li>
<li>It is a mostly desert region, producing about a fifth of the world’s cotton.</li>
<li>It is also rich in oil and natural gas and because of its proximity to Central Asia and Europe is seen by Beijing as an important trade link.</li>
</ul>

(a) Angola and Zambia<br/>
(b) Morocco and Tunisia<br/>
(c) Venezuela and Colombia<br/>
(d) Yemen and South Sudan</p>
<p> </p>
Post your answers here.</blockquote>
<h4>What was the build-up to the Uighur crackdown?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in Xinjiang from the 1990s, flaring into violence on occasion.</li>
<li>In 2009 some 200 people died in clashes in Xinjiang, which the Chinese blamed on Uighurs who want their own state.</li>
<li>Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces.</li>
<li>According to Human Rights Watch, police are also using a mobile app to monitor peoples’ behaviour, such as how much electricity they are using and how often they use their front door.</li>
<li>Since 2017 when President Xi Jinping issued an order saying all religions in China should be Chinese in orientation, there have been further crackdowns.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chinese narrative</h4>
<ul>
<li>China says the crackdown is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism.</li>
<li>It insists that Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest.</li>
<li>China has dismissed claims it is trying to reduce the Uighur population through mass sterilizations as “baseless”, and says allegations of forced labor are “completely fabricated”.</li>

<p>Since July 1, 2022, India has banned the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale, and use of single-use plastics (SUP) items with low utility and high littering potential.</p>
<h4>What are single-use plastics?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Single-use plastics, often also referred to as <strong><u>disposable plastics</u></strong>, are commonly used for plastic packaging and include items intended to be <strong><u>used only once</u></strong> before they are thrown away or recycled.</li>
<li>These include, among other items, grocery bags, food packaging, bottles, straws, containers, cups and cutlery.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why are single-use plastics harmful?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of single-use plastics is to use them once or for a short period of time before disposing of them. Plastic waste has drastic impacts on the environment and human health.</li>
<li>There is a greater likelihood of single-use plastic products <strong><u>ending up in the sea</u></strong> than reusable ones.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SUP ban in India</h4>
<ul>
<li>India has taken resolute steps to mitigate pollution caused by littered single-use plastics.</li>
<li>A number of items are banned, including earbuds with plastic sticks, balloon sticks, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice cream sticks, polystyrene (thermocol) for decorations, plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straws etc.</li>
<li>India has also banned plastic or PVC banners less than 100 micron, stirrers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the impact on the environment?</h4>
<p><strong>[A] Solid Waste generation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The disposal of plastics is one of the least recognized and most highly problematic areas of plastic’s ecological impact.</li>
<li>Ironically, one of plastic’s most desirable traits: its <strong>durability and resistance to decomposition</strong>, is also the source of one of its greatest liabilities when it comes to the disposal of plastics.</li>
<li>A very small amount of total plastic production (less than 10%) is effectively recycled; the remaining plastic is sent to landfills.</li>
<li>It is destined to remain entombed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[B] Ecological Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) Groundwater and soil pollution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plastic is a material made to last forever, and due to the same chemical composition, plastic cannot biodegrade; it breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces.</li>
<li>When buried in a landfill, plastic lies untreated for years.</li>
<li>In the process, toxic chemicals from plastics drain out and seep into groundwater, flowing downstream into lakes and rivers.</li>
<li>The seeping of plastic also causes soil pollution and have now started resulting in presence of micro plastics in soil.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(ii) Water Pollution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The increased presence of plastic on the ocean surface has resulted in more serious problems.</li>
<li>Since most of the plastic debris that reaches the ocean remains floating for years as it does not decompose quickly, it leads to the dropping of oxygen level in the water.</li>
<li>It has severely affected the survival of marine species.</li>
<li>When oceanic creatures and even birds consume plastic inadvertently, they choke on it which causes a steady decline in their population.</li>
<li>In addition to suffocation, ingestion, and other macro-particulate causes of death in larger birds, fish, and mammals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[C] Health Hazards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Burning of plastic results into formation of a class of flame retardants called as Halogens.</li>
<li>Collectively, these harmful chemicals are known to cause the following severe health problems: cancer, neurological damage, endocrine disruption, birth defects and child developmental disorders etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ban elsewhere</h4>
<ul>
<li>India is not the first country to ban single-use plastics.</li>
<li>Bangladesh became the first country to ban thin plastic bags in 2002; New Zealand banned plastic bags in July 2019.</li>
<li>China had issued a ban on plastic bags in 2020 with a phased implementation.</li>
<li>As of July 2019, 68 countries have plastic bag bans with varying degrees of enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the plastic waste management rules in India?</h4>
<ul>
<li>With effect from September 30, 2021 India has the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021.</li>
<li>It prohibited the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale, and use of plastic carry bags whose thickness is less than 75 microns.</li>
<li>From December 31, 2022, plastic carry bags whose thickness is less than 120 microns will be banned.</li>
<li>It means that the ban does not cover all plastic bags; however, it requires the manufacturers to produce plastic bags thicker than 75 microns which was earlier 50 microns.</li>
<li>As per the notification, the standard shall be increased to 120 microns in December this year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the role of the manufacturer?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2022 on February 16, 2022.</li>
<li>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is the responsibility of a producer for the environmentally sound management of the product until the end of its life.</li>
<li>The guidelines provide a framework to strengthen the circular economy of plastic packaging waste, promote the development of new alternatives to plastic packaging and provide the next steps for moving towards sustainable plastic packaging by businesses.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Various steps taken</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Indian government has taken steps to promote innovation and create an ecosystem for accelerated adoption and availability of alternatives across the country.</li>
<li>To ensure the effective enforcement of the ban, national and State-level control rooms will be established, as well as special enforcement teams for the purpose of checking the illegal sale and use of single-use plastics.</li>
<li>To prevent the movement of banned single-use plastic items between States and Union Territories, border checkpoints have been established.</li>
<li>In an effort to empower citizens to help curb the plastic menace, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has launched a grievance redressal application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the challenges?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ban will succeed only if all stakeholders participate enthusiastically and engage in effective engagement and concerted actions.</li>
<li>However, if we look back at our past, almost 25 Indian States previously banned plastic at the state level.</li>
<li>However, these bans had a very limited impact in reality because of the widespread use of these items.</li>
<li>Now the challenge is to see how the local level authorities will enforce the ban in accordance with the guidelines.</li>
<li>Banned items such as earbuds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, etc., are non-branded items and it is difficult to find out who the manufacturer is and who is accountable.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>The consumer needs to be informed about the ban through advertisements, newspaper or TV commercials, or on social media.</li>
<li>In order to find sustainable alternatives, companies need to invest in research and development.</li>
<li>The solution to the plastic pollution problem is not the responsibility of the government alone, but of industries, brands, manufacturers and most importantly consumers.</li>
<li>Finding alternatives to plastic seems a little difficult, however, greener alternatives to plastic may be considered a sustainable option.</li>
<li>For example, compostable and bio-degradable plastic, etc., may be considered as an option.</li>
<li>While the total ban on the use of plastic sounds a great idea, its feasibility seems difficult at this hour, especially in the absence of workable alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Can civil servants express their views on law, governance?</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why in news?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A senior IAS officer, Smita Sabharwal from Telangana, tweeted from her personal account in support of Ms. Bilkis Bano and questioned the Gujarat government’s decision, sparking off a row over whether she was in breach of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules of 1964 and reviving the debate on the freedom of civil servants to express their personal views on matters of law and governance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Who are civil servants?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In a modern democracy, a civil servant is an official in the service of the people and is recruited based on predetermined qualifications. Civil servants are bureaucrats who need to be familiar with the laws and regulations of the country and are expected to act in the best interests of the country and its citizens.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is their expected role?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>They are responsible for managing the resources given to them by the government and making use of them efficiently and effectively. A sound parliamentary system of government requires civil servants to maintain their integrity, fearlessness, and independence.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Civil servants" class="alignnone wp-image-629581" height="326" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ias_4-1571657168_1-300x224.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ias_4-1571657168_1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ias_4-1571657168_1.jpg 670w" width="437"/>What are Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules of 1964?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Conduct Rules lay down clear principles as to what the Government expects from its employees.</li>
<li>Conduct rules apply to both official and personal life of the government servant.</li>
<li>If an official violates conduct rules, he may face warning/disciplinary action/departmental proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is rule 9?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rule 9 of the Rules of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules states, “No Government servant shall… make any statement of fact or opinion… which has the effect of an adverse criticism of any current or recent policy or action of the Central Government or a State Government.”</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Civil servants" class="alignnone wp-image-629582" height="290" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-300x225.jpeg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DlxQhSLV4AAe75Q-1980x1485.jpeg 1980w" width="387"/>What is freedom of expression?          </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The citizens of country have the fundamental right of free speech guaranteed to them under the Constitution, which is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of securing the state’s sovereignty, international relations, health, morality, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What central conduct rules say?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>When you undertake a government service, you subject yourself to certain disciplinary rules. That prevents a government servant from becoming a member of a political organisation, or any organisation of such a nature, or expressing herself freely with regard to anything that has to do with the governance of the country.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How Indian rules are different than others?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the most important functions of the civil service, as stated by the head of the Canadian Public Service, is to <strong>“speak truth to power.”</strong></li>
<li>Which is prohibited in Indian context because this rule is of the British era. There is no doubt that the British were very, very strict and didn’t want their officers to be talking about how bad the governance was. But in a democracy, the right to criticise the government is a fundamental right and nobody can muzzle that.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What judiciary said in Lipika Paul vs The State Of Tripura case</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As a Government servant the petitioner is not devoid of her right of free speech, a fundamental right which can be curtailed only by a valid law.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Crux of this judgement in simple words</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>She (the petitioner) was entitled to hold her own beliefs and express them in the manner she desired, subject to not crossing the borders laid down in the Conduct Rules which were applicable in Tripura.</li>
<li>A fundamental right cannot be curtailed except by a valid law made by a legislature<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why this judgement is important?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It abrogated state from exploiting vague terms of the policy of government and government action to punish civil servants who criticize government of the day in any manner harsh or mild.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What Kerala high court said in 2018? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>One cannot be prevented from expressing his views merely because he/she is an government employee. In a democratic society, every institution is governed by democratic norms. Healthy criticism is a better way to govern a public institution.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why it is highly contextual here?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>This judgement indirectly protected constructive and just criticism by protecting fundamental rights of the civil servants.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Action of IAS officer can be justified?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Since she added the words ‘civil servant’ in her tweet is because the dharma of the civil servant is to uphold constitutional principles in letter and in spirit, and the rule of law.</li>
<li>In Bilkis Bano case, both the spirit of the Constitution and the rule of law were being subverted.</li>
<li>Hence her expression can be justified.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/civil-service-accountability-and-challenges-benefits-of-an-independent-permanent-and-impartial-civil-service/"><strong>Can we justify rule 9 here in this context?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The rules don’t violate Article 19. It is a rule, it’s not the law. It’s not in the Constitution. Freedom of speech is given in the Constitution, but these are Conduct Rules and they are imposed because there has to be some discipline in an organisation for that organisation to function.</li>
<li>There is a process of decision-making. Right from below, the matter is examined, the pros and cons are taken up, the bureaucracy is given an opportunity to examine all the aspects, write their notes of objection or support, and finally it reaches the political executive. When a policy is decided, it has to be obeyed and complied with by the bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anybody could challenge these rules as they are offending constitutional fundamental rights of civil servant; then the Supreme Court would be forced to come down and say either it is good, or it is bad, and give good reasons for that.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong><strong> Right time has arrived to challenge conduct rules of civil servants as their freedom of expression is curtailed by these rules. Critically analyse.</strong></p></blockquote>
