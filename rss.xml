<ul>
<li>Recent events of targeted killings of Kashmiri pandits and other Hindus by the militants in the valley lead to the protests which once again brought forward the question of their right to return and the safety of minorities living in the valley</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Who are the Kashmiri pandits?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Kashmiri Pandits are one of the highest ranked Brahman castes who are the natives of the valley, locally known as pundits.</li>
<li>They were the minority in the valley comprising only 5% of the total population.</li>
<li>Traditionally dependent on agriculture and small-scale business and one of the favored sections in the administration.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-kashmiri-pandit-exodus/"><strong>What is the conflict?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Radical Islamists and militants started targeting the Kashmiri pundits putting in front the option of either of conversion or persecution.</li>
<li>The Growth of militancy in the 1990s forced Kashmiri pandits to leave the valley in greater numbers. They started migrating to the other states, leaving every belonging behind and seeking refuge in other parts.</li>
<li>While many of them started migrating some decided to stay back in their homeland.</li>
<li>Conflict arose between radical Islamists organization and the Hindus leading to the mass killings of the Kashmiri Hindus in waves which is termed as exodus.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>After the Pandit exodus from the Valley in the 1990s, the first few years of this century saw government efforts to send Pandits back to the Valley.</li>
<li>Under the Prime Minister’s return and rehabilitation of Kashmir migrants scheme, created government postings in the Valley for Kashmiri Pandit “migrant” youth.</li>
<li>Mostly, teachers and these government employees have lived in protected high security enclaves, but their work requires them to leave these enclaves and mingle with the rest of the population. Another segment, known as “non-migrant” Pandits because they never left the Valley, has lived in their own homes, without state-provided protection.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is CDR?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Centre for dialogue and reconciliation (CDR) is a Delhi-based think-tank incorporated in March 2001, aims to be a catalyst for peace in South Asia.</li>
<li>CDR working for the peace-building process in Jammu Kashmir, supported the initiative of dialogue between the two communities as a part of self-assessment, acknowledging the mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="kashmiri pandits" class="alignnone wp-image-634947" height="324" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kashmiri-pandits-pti2-1654090920-300x192.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kashmiri-pandits-pti2-1654090920-300x192.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kashmiri-pandits-pti2-1654090920.jpg 715w" width="506"/>What did CDR do in Kashmir?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>CDR supported the initiative for a dialogue proposed by two prominent young Kashmiris one a Muslim and the other a Pandit both who have witnessed the violence of 1990 and the subsequent years.</li>
<li>They believe in the principle of talking could lead to healing.</li>
<li>It led to CDR’s ‘Shared Witness’, a Pandit-Muslim dialogue series, in December 2010.</li>
<li>Public intellectuals and other influential persons from both communities were participants</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Observations of the dialogue </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The dialogue series coincided with the launching of the Prime Minister’s job scheme.</li>
<li>Dialogues created a social environment that enabled Kashmiri Pandits to take up government postings in the Valley.</li>
<li>They focused on the events in and around 1990, and the incidents that triggered the displacement of the Pandit community.</li>
<li>By the third dialogue, participants were sharing individual experiences that did not fit into the narrative that each community had built about the other.</li>
<li>The process of the conversation lead them to think on the actual reason behind the conflict, was it communal differences, or was it only religion?</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>From the eyes of the pandits</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Pandits were aggrieved that the Muslims did not protest the Pandit killings, not even when the killers claimed them. That greater responsibility lay with the Muslims as they were the majority.</li>
<li>If some social organizations had acted quickly, the exodus could have been stopped.</li>
<li>They observed that the Pandit community too had suffered from a lack of leadership.</li>
<li>They demand an apology and to set up of possible “Truth commission”</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What do the Muslims say?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Muslim participants felt the Pandits were in denial of the struggle of the Muslims in the Valley, who were facing violence from the system.</li>
<li>The Kashmiri Muslim was always portrayed as being misguided, aided, and abetted by Pakistan.</li>
<li>The protest in Kashmir was not against religion but against structures of power and oppression.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the Current situation?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The fresh spate of targeted killings of Kashmir pandits created an environment of fear and provided a major setback to their rehabilitation in the Kashmir valley.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way ahead:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>We need urgent civil society engagement between communities in Kashmir once again.</li>
<li>The government can enable it, but individuals and civil society will need to create conditions on the ground. They will have to encourage people to give up the blame game.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ministry of Tourism identified Tourism Industry’s potential as a Sunrise Industry.</li>
<li>There is a need for tourism analysts to hold tourism planners accountable.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is tourism?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Types of tourism</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domestic tourism</strong>: Refers to activities of a visitor within their country of residence and outside of their home (e.g. a Indian visiting other parts of India)</li>
<li><strong>Inbound tourism</strong>: Refers to the activities of a visitor from outside of country of residence (e.g. a Spaniard visiting Britain).</li>
<li><strong>Outbound tourism</strong>: Refers to the activities of a resident visitor outside of their country of residence (e.g. an Indian visiting an overseas country).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does sustainable tourism mean?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable tourism is defined by the UN Environment Program and UN World Tourism Organization as “tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities.”</li>

<ul>
<li>Tourism boosts the revenue of the economy, creates thousands of jobs, develops the infrastructures of a country, and plants a sense of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why tourism is needed?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tourism is not a fad. It is a compulsion driven by the urge to discover new places. Because we have this compulsion to venture into the unknown, we need each other. When humans travel, meet and exchange ideas, civilisation flourishes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What should be done to promote tourism?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Tourism Authority</strong>: A separate National Tourism Authority (NTA) should be established for executing and operationalizing various tourism related initiatives. Simple, flexible and elegant processes will be laid down to allow for nimbleness.</li>
<li><strong>National Tourism Advisory Board</strong>: A National Tourism Advisory Board (NTAB) should be set up to provide overall vision, guidance and direction to the Development of Tourism Sector in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Synergy in Tourism Eco System</strong>: In order to ensure synergy at various levels of Government and with the Private Sector, it is important to have a well-defined framework in place.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Tourism Framework</strong>: A robust framework for quality certification of products and services across all segments like accommodation providers, tour operators, adventure tour operators, service providers like spa and wellness, guides, restaurants etc. should be laid down.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing the existing luxury tourism products:</strong> The existing tourism products such as Nilgiri Mountain Railway, Palace on Wheels etc. should be enhanced and their numbers will also be increased. Haulage charges will be rationalised to make luxury trains viable.</li>
<li><strong>Railways can be a game changer:</strong> For tourism Railways have presence in most parts of the country. Most of the tourist destinations in the country are connected by rail. Railways is also in the process of connecting more places especially the strategic locations that also are tourist places with limited connectivity at present. Indian Railways is working towards promoting tourism in the country by operating more trains connecting tourists’ destinations and also by providing an array of products starting from luxury tourist trains to budget catering tourist trains</li>

<p>The characteristics of cloud burst events remain elusive, and our efforts in monitoring and forecasting them is at an embryonic stage.</p>
<p>Cyclones can be predicted about one week in advance. However, <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-are-cloudbursts/">cloudburst</a> forecasts still remain elusive.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Cloudbursts?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A cloudburst is a localised but intense rainfall activity.</li>
<li>Short spells of very heavy rainfall over a small geographical area can cause widespread destruction, especially in hilly regions where this phenomenon is the most common.</li>
<li>Not all instances of very heavy rainfall, however, are cloudbursts.</li>
<li>A cloudburst has a very specific definition: Rainfall of 10 cm or more in an hour over a roughly 10 km x 10-km area is classified as a cloudburst event.</li>
<li>By this definition, 5 cm of rainfall in a half-hour period over the same area would also be categorized as a cloudburst.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Which clouds do burst?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Cloudburst events are often associated with <strong><u>cumulonimbus clouds</u></strong> that cause thunderstorms and occasionally due to monsoon wind surges and other weather phenomena.</li>
<li>Cumulonimbus clouds can grow up to <strong><u>12-15 km in height</u></strong> through the entire troposphere (occasionally up to 21 km) and can hold huge amounts of water.</li>
<li>Tall cumulonimbus clouds can develop in about half an hour as the moisture updraft happens rapidly, at a pace of 60 to 120 km/hr.</li>
<li>A single-cell cloud may last for an hour and <strong><u>dump all the rain in the last 20 to 30 minutes</u></strong>, while some of these clouds merge to form multi-cell storms and last for several hours.</li>
<li>However, cloudbursts are not defined based on cloud characteristics and do not indicate clouds exploding. Cloudbursts are defined by the amount of rainfall.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How is it different from normal rainfall?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), 100 mm of rain in an hour is called a cloudburst.</li>
<li>Usually, cloudbursts occur over a small geographical region of 20 to 30 sq. km.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>When do they occur? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In India, cloudbursts often occur during the monsoon season, when the southwesterly monsoon winds bring in copious amounts of moisture inland.</li>
<li>The moist air that converges over land gets lifted as they encounter the hills.</li>
<li>The moist air reaches an altitude and gets saturated, and the water starts condensing out of the air forming clouds.</li>
<li>This is how clouds usually form, but such an orographic lifting together with a strong moisture convergence can lead to intense cumulonimbus clouds taking in huge volumes of moisture that is dumped during cloudbursts.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How common are cloudbursts?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Cloudbursts are not uncommon events, particularly during the monsoon months.</li>
<li>Most of these happen in the Himalayan states where the local topology, wind systems, and temperature gradients between the lower and upper atmosphere facilitate the occurrence of such events.</li>
<li>However, not every event that is described as a cloudburst is actually, by definition, a cloudburst.</li>
<li>That is because these events are highly localized.</li>
<li>They take place in very small areas which are often devoid of rainfall measuring instruments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Climate change and cloudbursts: How are they related?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of cloudbursts worldwide.</li>
<li>As the air gets warmer, it can hold more moisture and for a longer time. We call this the <strong><u>Clausius Clapeyron relationship. </u></strong></li>
<li>A <strong><u>1-degree Celsius rise in temperature may correspond to a 7-10% increase in moisture and rainfall</u></strong>.</li>
<li>This increase in <strong><u>rainfall amount does not get spread moderately</u></strong> throughout the season.</li>
<li>As the moisture holding <strong><u>capacity of air increases</u></strong>, it results in prolonged dry periods intermittent with short spells of extreme rains.</li>
<li><strong><u>Deeper cumulonimbus clouds will form</u></strong> and the chances of cloudbursts also increase.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why are they so destructive?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The consequences of these events, however, <strong><u>are not confined to small areas</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Because of the nature of terrain, the heavy rainfall events often <strong><u>trigger landslides and flash floods</u></strong>, causing extensive destruction downstream.</li>
<li>This is the reason why every sudden downpour that leads to destruction of life and property in the hilly areas gets described as a “cloudburst”, irrespective of whether the amount of rainfall meets the defining criteria.</li>
<li>At the same time, it is also possible that actual cloudburst events in remote locations aren’t recorded.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Detecting cloudbursts</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Satellites are extensively useful in detecting large-scale monsoon weather systems.</li>
<li>However the <strong><u>resolution of the precipitation radars of these satellites can be much smaller</u></strong> than the area of individual cloudburst events, and hence they go undetected.</li>
<li>Weather <strong><u>forecast models also face a similar challenge</u></strong> in simulating the clouds at a high resolution.</li>
<li>The skillful forecasting of rainfall in hilly regions remains challenging due to the uncertainties in the interaction between the <strong><u>moisture convergence and the hilly terrain</u></strong>.</li>
<li>There also involves the <strong><u>cloud microphysics, and the heating-cooling mechanisms</u></strong> at different atmospheric levels.</li>
<li><strong><u>Multiple radars</u></strong> can be a quick measure for providing warnings, but radars <strong><u>are an expensive affair</u></strong>, and installing them across the country may not be practically feasible.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solutions to cloudbursts forecast</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Multiple doppler weather radars</u></strong> can be used to monitor moving cloud droplets and help to provide nowcasts (forecasts for the next three hours).</li>
<li>A long-term measure would be <strong><u>mapping the cloudburst-prone regions</u></strong> using automatic rain gauges.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>CAA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>A three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) U U Lalit will hear the challenge to the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The act is sought <strong>to</strong> <strong>amend the Citizenship Act, 1955</strong> to make Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, eligible for citizenship of India.</li>
<li>In other words, it intends to make it easier for non-Muslim immigrants from India’s three Muslim-majority neighbours to become citizens of India.</li>
<li>Under The Citizenship Act, 1955, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalization is that the applicant must have resided in India during the last 12 months, as well as for 11 of the previous 14 years.</li>
<li>The amendment relaxes the second requirement from 11 years to 6 years as a specific condition for applicants belonging to these six religions, and the aforementioned three countries.</li>
<li>It exempts the members of the six communities from any criminal case under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Passport Act, 1920 if they entered India before December 31, 2014.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key feature: Defining illegal migrants</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Illegal migrants cannot become Indian citizens in accordance with the present laws.</li>
<li>Under the CAA, an illegal migrant is a foreigner who: (i) enters the country without valid travel documents like a passport and visa, or (ii) enters with valid documents, but stays beyond the permitted time period.</li>
<li>Illegal migrants may be put in jail or deported under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Exceptions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Bill provides that illegal migrants who fulfil four conditions will not be treated as illegal migrants under the Act.  The conditions are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>they are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians;</li>
<li>they are from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan;</li>
<li>they entered India on or before December 31, 2014;</li>
<li>they are not in certain tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, or Tripura included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, or areas under the “Inner Line” permit, i.e., Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Controversy with the Act</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Country of Origin:</strong> The Act classifies migrants based on their country of origin to include only Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</li>
<li><strong>Other religious minorities ignored:</strong> It is unclear why illegal migrants from only six specified religious minorities have been included in the Act.</li>
<li><strong>Defiance of purpose:</strong> India shares a border with Myanmar, which has had a history of persecution of a religious minority, the Rohingya Muslims.</li>
<li><strong>Date of Entry:</strong> It is also unclear why there is a differential treatment of migrants based on their date of entry into India, i.e., whether they entered India before or after December 31, 2014.</li>
<li><strong>Against the spirit of Secularism:</strong> Further, granting citizenship on the grounds of religion is seen to be against the secular nature of the Constitution which has been recognised as part of the basic structure that cannot be altered by Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basis of challenging in Supreme Court</h4>
<ul>
<li>The challenge rests primarily on the grounds that the <strong><u>law violates Article 14 of the Constitution</u></strong> that guarantees that no person shall be denied the right to equality before law or the equal protection of law in the territory of India.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Supreme Court has developed a <strong><u>two-pronged test to examine a law</u></strong> on the grounds of Article 14.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, any <strong><u>differentiation between groups</u></strong> of persons must be founded on “intelligible differentia”</li>
<li>Second, that <strong><u>differentia must have a rational nexus</u></strong> to the object sought to be achieved by the Act</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Simply put, for a law to satisfy the conditions under Article 14, it has to first create a <strong><u>“reasonable class” of subjects</u></strong> that it seeks to govern under the law.</li>
<li>Even <strong><u>if the classification is reasonable</u></strong>, any person who falls in that category has to be treated alike.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What happens next?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The listing of the CAA challenge indicates that the <strong><u>hearing will be fast-tracked</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The court will have to ensure that all pleadings, written submissions are filed and served to the opposite party before it is listed for final hearing.</li>
<li>Some petitioners could also seek a <strong><u>referral to a larger Constitution Bench</u></strong>.</li>
<li>However, the challenge is to a statute and does not directly involve interpretation of the Constitution.</li>
<li>These issues are also likely to be debated before the court allots time for the final hearing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India is a constitutional democracy with a basic structure that assures a secure and spacious home for all Indians.</li>
<li>Being partitioned on religious grounds, India has to undertake a balancing act for protecting the religious minorities in its neighbourhood.</li>
<li>These minorities are under constant threat of persecution and vandalism.</li>
<li>India needs to balance its civilization duties to protect those who are prosecuted in the neighbourhood.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>African cheetahs from Namibia will arrive in India September 17, 2022. This is the world’s first intercontinental translocation of a carnivore. It is even more unique because this is the first time cheetahs will be reintroduced in an unfenced protected area (PA).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>About Asiatic Cheetah</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature:</strong> Cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal was declared extinct in India in 1952.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: The Asiatic cheetah is classified as a “critically endangered” species by the IUCN Red List, and is believed to survive only in Iran.</li>
<li><strong>Reintroduction</strong>: It was expected to be re-introduced into the country after the Supreme Court lifted curbs for its re-introduction.</li>
<li><strong>Extinction: </strong>From 400 in the 1990s, their numbers are estimated to have reached to 50-70 today, because of poaching, hunting of their main prey (gazelles) and encroachment on their habitat.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Cheetah" class="alignnone wp-image-635349" height="332" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cheeta-1-300x253.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cheeta-1-300x253.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cheeta-1.jpg 751w" width="394"/>Distribution of cheetahs in India</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Historically, Asiatic cheetahs had a very wide distribution in India.</li>
<li>There are authentic reports of their occurrence from as far north as Punjab to Tirunelveli district in southern Tamil Nadu, from Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west to Bengal in the east.</li>
<li>Most of the records are from a belt extending from Gujarat passing through Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha.</li>
<li>There is also a cluster of reports from southern Maharashtra extending to parts of Karnataka, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</li>
<li>The distribution range of the cheetah was wide and spread all over the subcontinent. They occurred in substantial numbers.</li>
<li>The cheetah’s habitat was also diverse, favouring the more open habitats: scrub forests, dry grasslands, savannahs and other arid and semi-arid open habitats.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Reduced fecundity and high infant mortality in the wild</li>
<li>Inability to breed in captivity</li>
<li>Sport hunting and</li>
<li>Bounty killings</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/reintroduction-of-african-cheetahs-in-indian-forests/"><strong>Historic data on cheetah</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is reported that the Mughal Emperor Akbar had kept 1,000 cheetahs in his menagerie and collected as many as 9,000 cats during his half-century reign from 1556 to 1605.</li>
<li>The cheetah numbers were fast depleting by the end of the 18th century even though their prey base and habitat survived till much later.</li>
<li>It is recorded that the last cheetahs were shot in India in 1947, but there are credible reports of sightings of the cat till about 1967.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Experts find it difficult whether the African cheetahs would find the sanctuary a favourable climate as far as the abundance of prey is concerned.</li>
<li>The habitat of cheetahs is needed to support a genetically viable population.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why reintroduce Cheetahs?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Reintroductions of large carnivores have increasingly been recognized as a strategy to conserve threatened species and restore ecosystem functions.</li>
<li>The cheetah is the only large carnivore that has been extirpated, mainly by over-hunting in India in historical times.</li>
<li>India now has the economic ability to consider restoring its lost natural heritage for ethical as well as ecological reasons.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains questions</strong></p>
<p><strong> Q. Reintroductions of large carnivores have increasingly been recognized as a strategy to conserve threatened species and restore ecosystem functions. Discuss in context of cheetah reintroduction in India.</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>India’s statistics ministry generates only one high-frequency gauge of economic activity. And that lone barometer, the index of industrial production (IIP), is completely broken.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is IIP?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an index that indicates the performance of various industrial sectors of the Indian economy. It is a composite indicator of the general level of industrial activity in the economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="IIP" class="alignnone wp-image-635381" height="261" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/73818-factory-output-reuters-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/73818-factory-output-reuters-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/73818-factory-output-reuters-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/73818-factory-output-reuters.jpg 850w" width="463"/>How is IIP calculated?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>IIP is calculated as the weighted average of production relatives of all the industrial activities. In the mathematical calculation Laspeyre’s fixed base formula is used.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are the Core Industries in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The main or the key industries constitute the core sectors of an economy.</li>
<li>In India, there are eight sectors that are considered the core sectors.</li>
<li>They are electricity, steel, refinery products, crude oil, coal, cement, natural gas and fertilizers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Which has highest weightage in IIP?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The eight core sector industries in decreasing order of their weightage: Refinery Products&gt; Electricity&gt; Steel&gt; Coal&gt; Crude Oil&gt; Natural Gas&gt; Cement&gt; Fertilizers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="IIP" class="alignnone wp-image-635383" height="312" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/linh-vuc-san-xuat-cua-viet-nam-300x196.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/linh-vuc-san-xuat-cua-viet-nam-300x196.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/linh-vuc-san-xuat-cua-viet-nam-768x501.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/linh-vuc-san-xuat-cua-viet-nam.jpg 800w" width="478"/>Why is IIP important?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>IIP is the only measure on the physical volume of production. It is used by government agencies including the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank of India, etc. for policy-making purposes. IIP remains extremely relevant for the calculation of the quarterly and advance GDP estimates.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Who releases IIP data?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The IIP data is compiled and published by CSO every month.</li>
<li>CSO or Central Statistical Organisation operates under the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-are-the-first-advance-estimates-of-gdp/">Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).</a></li>
<li>The IIP index data, once released, is also available on the PIB website.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How useful are monthly IIP figures to draw a conclusion about India’s growth?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>IIP figures are monthly data and as such it keeps going up and down.</li>
<li>In fact, the release calls them “quick estimates” because they tend to get revised after a month or two.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>IIP Index Components</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Mining, manufacturing, and electricity are the three broad sectors in which IIP constituents fall.</li>
<li>The relative weights of these three sectors are 77.6% (manufacturing), 14.4% (mining) and 8% (electricity).</li>
<li>Electricity, crude oil, coal, cement, steel, refinery products, natural gas, and fertilizers are the eight core industries that comprise about 40 per cent of the weight of items included in the IIP.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Basket of products</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Primary Goods (consisting of mining, electricity, fuels and fertilisers)</li>
<li>Capital Goods (e.g. machinery items)</li>
<li>Intermediate Goods (e.g. yarns, chemicals, semi-finished steel items, etc)</li>
<li>Infrastructure Goods (e.g. paints, cement, cables, bricks and tiles, rail materials, etc)</li>
<li>Consumer Durables (e.g. garments, telephones, passenger vehicles, etc)</li>
<li>Consumer Non-durables (e.g. food items, medicines, toiletries, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>IIP base year change</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The base year was changed to 2011-12 from 2004-05 in the year 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way ahead </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>IIP remains extremely relevant for the calculation of the quarterly and advance GDP (Gross Domestic Product) estimates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you understand by IIP? How it helps us to understand economic health?</strong></p></blockquote>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>FASTags, GPS</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-635419" height="261" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gps-toll-300x150.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gps-toll-300x150.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gps-toll-768x384.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gps-toll.jpg 900w" width="522"/></p>
<p>The government plans to start a GPS-based toll system in place of FASTag to ensure seamless payment and vehicle movement on national highways.</p>
<p><strong>Why in news?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The move would end the role of toll plazas across the country.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How will a GPS-based tolling system work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vehicles will be fitted with an electronic device that can track their movement.</li>
<li>Highways will be geo-fenced, creating virtual boundaries. The system will use GPS or radio frequency identification technologies.</li>
<li>The software will recognize when a mobile device enters or leaves a particular area, and toll will be charged based on the distance travelled at the highway’s exit point.</li>
<li>As the system is based on sensors, there will be no need to stop at toll plazas.</li>
<li>Vehicles and users must be registered with the GPS toll system, linked to bank accounts that will be used to transfer toll payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are FASTags?</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-implementation-of-fastags/">FASTags</a> are stickers that are affixed to the windscreen of vehicles and use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to enable digital, contactless payment of tolls without having to stop at toll gates.</li>
<li>RFID uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.</li>
<li>The tags are linked to bank accounts and other payment methods.</li>
<li>As a car crosses a toll plaza, the amount is automatically deducted, and a notification is sent to the registered mobile phone number.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with FASTags</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the card is affixed to the windscreen, it can be easily <strong><u>misplaced, damaged or stolen</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The existing FASTag system, though faster than cash payments, <strong><u>still requires vehicles to stop at toll booths to enable reading of tags. </u></strong></li>
<li>Also, the <strong><u>vehicle must wait till the gate is opened</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It has been observed that sometimes the <strong><u>toll fee is deducted twice</u></strong> from user account. Mostly, this happens due to a technical glitch.</li>
<li>Some card readers take <strong><u>longer time to read and register</u></strong>. Hence the <strong><u>purpose of saving time is itself defied.</u></strong></li>
<li>Still, the <strong><u>wait time at toll booths is much more than the 30 seconds</u></strong> that was promised earlier.</li>
<li>Also, it has <strong><u>not helped reduce the number of toll booths</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the benefits of using FASTag far outweigh the challenges.</p>
<h4>Is FASTags a total failure?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Usage has increased</u></strong> since FASTag was made mandatory in 2021 after its launch in 2015.</li>
<li><strong><u>Penetration has grown</u></strong> from nearly 16% in FY18 to 96.3% in FY22.</li>
<li>Total toll collection in FY18 was ₹21,948 crore, including ₹3,532 crore collected through FASTags.</li>
<li>In FY22, <strong><u>toll collection through FASTags increased</u></strong> sharply to ₹33,274 crore out of total toll collection of ₹34,535 crore.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How will GPS benefit highway users?</h4>
<ul>
<li>GPS tolling uses satellite-based navigation and <strong><u>requires no halting</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Also, <strong><u>vehicles can be charged only for their actual travel</u></strong> on a highway stretch.</li>
<li>Currently, toll is paid at toll booths which is <strong><u>fixed between two points of tolling</u></strong> and a <strong><u>user does not get any concession even if he/she exits before completing the full run</u></strong> between two toll plazas.</li>
<li>The new system should <strong><u>reduce the toll amount charged</u></strong> for travel on highways.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the progress so far on GPS tolling?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Union road ministry has <strong><u>amended</u></strong> the <strong><u>National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008</u></strong>, allowing for the collection of toll based on distance travelled on national highways.</li>
<li>This will facilitate the introduction of GPS tolling.</li>
<li>First trials may be done on the under-construction Mumbai-Delhi expressway which will be geo-fenced.</li>
<li>Also the <strong><u>cost of GPS devices</u></strong> needs to be considered at very beginning.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>The system needs <strong><u>a proper legislative framework</u></strong>, and a full launch is still years away. The government intends to introduce it in phases.</li>
<li>The road ministry is expected to amend the Motor Vehicles Act and create rules to facilitate GPS tolling as well as to <strong><u>penalize offenders</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Moreover, <strong><u>GPS will come with its own set of complications on calculating differential tolls</u></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>Regulations and framework</u></strong> for these need to be developed first.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Collegium system, NJAC</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The Supreme Court Collegium led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) U.U. Lalit has recommended eight names for appointment to the Bombay High Court.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Collegium System?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-collegium-system/">Collegium</a> of judges is the Indian Supreme Court’s invention.</li>
<li>It does not figure in the Constitution, which says judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts are appointed by the President and speaks of a process of consultation.</li>
<li>In effect, it is a system under which judges are appointed by an institution comprising judges.</li>
<li>After some judges were superseded in the appointment of the CJI in the 1970s, and attempts made subsequently to effect a mass transfer of High Court judges across the country.</li>
<li>Hence there was a perception that the independence of the judiciary was under threat. This resulted in a series of cases over the years.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Evolution: The Judges Cases</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Judges Case (1981)</strong> ruled that the “consultation” with the CJI in the matter of appointments must be full and effective.</li>
<li>However, it rejected the idea that the CJI’s opinion, albeit carrying great weight, should have primacy.</li>
<li><strong>Second Judges Case (1993)</strong> introduced the Collegium system, holding that “consultation” really meant “concurrence”.</li>
<li>It added that it was not the CJI’s individual opinion, but an institutional opinion formed in consultation with the two senior-most judges in the Supreme Court.</li>
<li><strong>Third Judges Case (1998):</strong> On a Presidential Reference for its opinion, the Supreme Court, in the Third Judges Case (1998) expanded the Collegium to a five-member body, comprising the CJI and four of his senior-most colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>The procedure followed by the Collegium</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Appointment of CJI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The President of India appoints the CJI and the other SC judges.</li>
<li>As far as the CJI is concerned, the outgoing CJI recommends his successor.</li>
<li>In practice, it has been strictly by seniority ever since the supersession controversy of the 1970s.</li>
<li>The Union Law Minister forwards the recommendation to the PM who, in turn, advises the President.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other SC Judges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For other judges of the top court, the proposal is initiated by the CJI.</li>
<li>The CJI consults the rest of the Collegium members, as well as the senior-most judge of the court hailing from the High Court to which the recommended person belongs.</li>
<li>The consultees must record their opinions in writing and it should form part of the file.</li>
<li>The Collegium sends the recommendation to the Law Minister, who forwards it to the Prime Minister to advise the President.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For High Courts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The CJs of High Courts are appointed as per the policy of having Chief Justices from outside the respective States. The Collegium takes the call on the elevation.</li>
<li>High Court judges are recommended by a Collegium comprising the CJI and two senior-most judges.</li>
<li>The proposal, however, is initiated by the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned in consultation with two senior-most colleagues.</li>
<li>The recommendation is sent to the Chief Minister, who advises the Governor to send the proposal to the Union Law Minister.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Does the Collegium recommend transfers too?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the Collegium also recommends the transfer of Chief Justices and other judges.</li>
<li>Article 222 of the Constitution provides for the transfer of a judge from one High Court to another.</li>
<li>When a CJ is transferred, a replacement must also be simultaneously found for the High Court concerned. There can be an acting CJ in a High Court for not more than a month.</li>
<li>In matters of transfers, the opinion of the CJI “is determinative”, and the consent of the judge concerned is not required.</li>
<li>However, the CJI should take into account the views of the CJ of the High Court concerned and the views of one or more SC judges who are in a position to do so.</li>
<li>All transfers must be made in the public interest, that is, “for the betterment of the administration of justice”.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Loopholes in the Collegium system</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Opaqueness and a lack of transparency, and the scope for nepotism are cited often.</li>
<li><strong>Judges appointing Judge:</strong> The attempt made to replace it with a ‘National Judicial Appointments Commission’ was struck down by the court in 2015 on the ground that it posed a threat to the independence of the judiciary.</li>
<li><strong>Criteria:</strong> Some do not believe in full disclosure of reasons for transfers, as it may make lawyers in the destination court chary of the transferred judge.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way ahead</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In respect of appointments, there has been an acknowledgment that the “zone of consideration” must be expanded to avoid criticism that many appointees hail from families of retired judges.</li>
<li>The status of a proposed new memorandum of procedure, to infuse greater accountability, is also unclear.</li>
<li>Even the majority opinions admitted the need for transparency, now Collegiums’ resolutions are now posted online, but reasons are not given.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>EWS Quota , 103rd Amendment</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The Supreme Court will today examine whether The Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, which introduced a 10 per cent quota for <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/economically-weaker-sections-ews-as-defined-by-govt-panel/">Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)</a> in government jobs and admissions, violates the basic structure of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>What is the news?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Constitution Bench has decided to examine three key issues to ascertain the validity of the amendment.</li>
<li>The challenge to the EWS quota was referred to a five-judge Bench in August 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>EWS Quota: A backgrounder</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The 10% reservation was introduced through the 103rd Constitution Amendment and enforced in January 2019.</li>
<li>It added Clause (6) to Article 15 to empower the Government to introduce special provisions for the EWS among citizens except those in the classes that already enjoy reservation.</li>
<li>It allows reservation in educational institutions, both public and private, whether aided or unaided, excluding those run by minority institutions, up to a maximum of 10%.</li>
<li>It also added Clause (6) to Article 16 to facilitate reservation in employment.</li>
<li>The new clauses make it clear that the EWS reservation will be in addition to the existing reservation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>EWS quota: What are the issues fixed by the Supreme Court?</h4>
<p>Attorney General K K Venugopal had drafted <strong><u>four issues related to </u></strong><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/mains/the-basic-structure-and-essential-feature-govern-now-the-political-and-juristic-destiny-of-indian-constitutional-development-comment-10-marks/"><strong>Basic Structure</strong></a> for the consideration of the Bench.  On September 8, the court decided to take up three of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether the 103rd Constitution Amendment can be said to breach the basic structure of the Constitution <strong><u>by permitting the state to make special provisions, including reservation, based on economic criteria</u></strong>”;</li>
<li>Whether the amendment can be said to breach the basic structure <strong><u>by permitting the state to make special provisions in relation to admission to private unaided institutions</u></strong></li>
<li>Whether the basic structure is violated by excluding the SEBCs (Socially and Educationally Backward Classes)/ OBCs (Other Backward Classes)/ SCs (Scheduled Castes)/ STs (Scheduled Tribes) from the scope of EWS reservation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What is the 103rd Amendment?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 103rd Amendment inserted Articles 15(6) and 16(6) in the Constitution to provide up to 10 per cent reservation to EWS other than backward classes, SCs, and STs in higher educational institutions and initial recruitment in government jobs.</li>
<li>The amendment empowered state governments to provide reservation on the basis of economic backwardness.</li>
<li>Article 15 prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</li>
<li>Article 16 guarantees equal opportunity in matters of public employment.</li>
<li>The additional clauses gave Parliament the power to make special laws for EWS like it does for SCs, STs, and OBCs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basis of EWS reservation: Sinho Commission</h4>
<ul>
<li>The EWS reservation was granted based on the recommendations of a commission headed by <strong><u>Major General (retd) S R Sinho. </u></strong></li>
<li>The commission, which was <strong><u>constituted in March 2005</u></strong> by the UPA government, <strong><u>submitted its report in July 2010.</u></strong></li>
<li>It recommended that <strong><u>all below-poverty-line (BPL) families</u></strong> <strong><u>within the general category</u></strong> and also all families <strong><u>whose annual family income from all sources is below the taxable limit</u></strong>, should be identified as EBCs (economically backward classes).</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is EWS status determined under the law?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The EWS criteria for employment and admission was notified on January 31, 2019 by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) based on the 103rd Amendment.</li>
<li>Under the 2019 notification:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A person who was not covered under the scheme of reservation for SCs, STs, and OBCs, and</li>
<li>Whose family had a gross annual income below Rs 8 lakh, was to be identified as EWS for the benefit of reservation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The notification specified what constituted “income”, and excluded some persons from the EWS category if their families possessed certain specified assets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Debate over the criteria</h4>
<ul>
<li>In October 2021, <strong><u>the Supreme Court</u></strong> <strong><u>asked the government how the threshold of Rs 8 lakh had been reached</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The Centre told the court that it would <strong><u>revisit the income criterion</u></strong>, and set up a three-member panel for this purpose.</li>
<li>In January this year, the government accepted the committee’s report, which said that the threshold of <strong><u>Rs 8 lakh of annual family income seems reasonable</u></strong> for determining EWS and may be retained.</li>
<li>However, the committee said, EWS may exclude, irrespective of income, a person whose family has <strong><u>5 acres of agricultural land and above. </u></strong></li>
<li>Also, the committee recommended, the <strong><u>residential asset criteria may altogether be removed</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the basis of the challenge to the amendment?</h4>
<h4>(1) Vagueness of Basic Structure</h4>
<ul>
<li>The primary argument in this case is that the amendment violates the basic structure of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Although there is <strong><u>no clear definition of basic structure</u></strong>, any law that violates it is understood to be unconstitutional.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(2) Burden of Proof</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a law is challenged, the <strong><u>burden of proving it is unconstitutional lies on the petitioners</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(3) Sole economic criteria</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 103rd Amendment departs from this by promising special <strong><u>protections on the sole basis of economic status</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(4) Violating 50% cap</h4>
<ul>
<li>The petitioners have also challenged the amendment on the ground that it violates the Supreme Court’s 1992 ruling in <strong><u>Indra Sawhney &amp; Ors v Union of India</u></strong>.</li>
<li>This has <strong><u>upheld the Mandal report</u></strong> and capped reservations at 50 per cent.</li>
<li>The court had held that <strong><u>economic backwardness cannot be the sole criterion</u></strong> for identifying a backward class.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(5) Rights of educational institutions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Another challenge is on behalf of private, unaided educational institutions.</li>
<li>They have argued that their fundamental right to practise a trade/ profession is violated when the <strong><u>state compels them to implement its reservation policy</u></strong> and admit students on any criteria other than merit.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What has been the government’s stand in this matter so far?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In counter-affidavits, the govt has said that <strong><u>the state has a duty</u></strong> to protect the interests of economically weaker sections.</li>
<li>Against the argument of violation of the basic structure, the government said that the <strong><u>very identity of the Constitution has NOT been altered</u></strong>.</li>
<li>On the Indra Sawhney principle, the government has relied on the <strong><u>SC’s 2008 ruling in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v Union of India</u></strong>, in which the court upheld the 27 per cent quota for OBCs.</li>
<li>The argument is that the co<strong><u>urt accepted that the definition of OBCs was not made on the sole criterion of caste but a mix of caste and economic factors</u></strong>; thus, there need not be a sole criterion for according reservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>India voiced concern over the “lack of measurable progress” in Sri Lanka’s promised political solution to the long-pending Tamil national question.</p>
<h4><strong>Back in news: Tamil Issue<br/>
</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India has made an unexpected (for SL) reference to the crisis-hit island nation’s “debt-driven” economy in the context of its current crisis.</li>
<li>Indian delegation noted the lack of measurable progress by Government of Sri Lanka on their commitments of a political solution to the ethnic issue.</li>
<li>It sought for full implementation of the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-the-13th-amendment-to-the-sri-lankan-constitution-and-why-is-it-contentious/">13th Amendment</a> of the Constitution, delegation of powers to Provincial Councils and holding of Provincial Council elections at the earliest.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Has India retreated from supporting Sri Lanka?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s statement comes ahead of a resolution on Sri Lanka that will likely face a vote at the Council.</li>
<li>Since 2009, India has voted thrice in favour of the UN resolution on Sri Lanka — two were critical — and abstained twice, in 2014 and 2021.</li>
<li>Irrespective of its vote, India has consistently underscored the need for a political settlement within the framework of a united Sri Lanka, ensuring justice, peace, equality and dignity for the Tamils of Sri Lanka.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Issues faced by Tamils in Sri Lanka</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>According to Freedom House’s Freedom in the World 2016 report on Sri Lanka, Tamils report systematic discrimination in areas including government employment, university education, and access to justice.</li>
<li>A large portion of the Tamil population still remains displaced.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the Tamil issue in Sri Lanka?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Violent persecution against the Tamil population erupted in the form of the 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983 anti-Tamil pogroms in Sri Lanka.</li>
<li>Over 13 years since the end of <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-india-sri-lanka-relations-in-recent-times/">Sri Lanka’s civil war</a>, in which tens of thousands of civilians were killed and disappeared, survivors continue demanding justice and accountability for war-time crimes.</li>
<li>In the post-war years, Sri Lanka’s human rights defenders have frequently flagged concerns over persisting militarisation, especially in the Tamil-majority north and east; repression, and the shrinking space for dissent.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is an outcome of the Indo-Lanka Accord of <strong><u>July 1987</u></strong>, <strong><u>signed by the then PM Rajiv Gandhi</u></strong> and President J.R. Jayawardene, in an attempt to resolve the ethnic conflict and civil war.</li>
<li>The 13th Amendment led to the creation of Provincial Councils and assured a power-sharing arrangement to enable all nine provinces in the country, including Sinhala majority areas, to self-govern.</li>
<li>Subjects such as education, health, agriculture, housing, land and police are devolved to the provincial administrations.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why is it contentious?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The 13th Amendment carries considerable <strong><u>baggage from the country’s civil war years</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It was opposed vociferously by both Sinhala nationalist parties and the LTTE.</li>
<li>The opposition within Sri Lanka saw the Accord and the consequent legislation as an imprint of Indian intervention.</li>
<li>It was widely perceived as an imposition by a <strong><u>neighbour wielding hegemonic influence</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The Tamil polity, especially its dominant nationalist strain, does not find the 13th Amendment sufficient in its ambit or substance.</li>
<li>However, some find it as an important starting point, something to build upon.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why India objects over this?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Because of restrictions on financial powers and <strong><u>overriding powers given to the President</u></strong>, the provincial administrations have not made much headway.</li>
<li>In particular, the <strong><u>provisions relating to police and land have never been implemented</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why is it significant?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Till date, the Amendment represents the only <strong><u>constitutional provision on the settlement of the long-pending Tamil question.</u></strong></li>
<li>In addition to assuring a measure of devolution, it is considered part of the few significant gains since the 1980s, in the face of <strong><u>growing Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarianism</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Religious places issues in India</p></div></div><p><img alt="gyanvapi" class="alignnone wp-image-635417" height="231" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gyanvapi-300x150.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gyanvapi-300x150.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gyanvapi-768x384.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gyanvapi.jpg 900w" width="462"/></p>
<p>The Varanasi District and Sessions Court has rejected the plea of the organization which manages the Gyanvapi mosque complex, challenging the maintainability of the civil suits filed by some women seeking the right to worship Goddesses on the outer wall of the complex.</p>
<h4>About Gyanvapi Mosque</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Gyanvapi Mosque was built in 1669 during the reign of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ordered the demolition of the existing Vishweshwar temple at the site, and its replacement by a mosque.</li>
<li>The plinth of the temple was left untouched, and served as the courtyard of the mosque.</li>
<li>One of the walls too was spared, and it became the qibla wall, the most important wall in a mosque that faces Mecca.</li>
<li>Material from the destroyed temple was used to build the mosque, evidence of which can be seen today.</li>
<li>The name of the mosque is said to have derived from an adjoining well, the Gyanvapi, or Well of Knowledge.</li>
<li>An old sculpture of the Nandi bull inside the compound of the present Kashi Vishwanath Temple faces the wall of the mosque instead of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.</li>
<li>It is believed that Nandi is in fact, facing the sanctum sanctorum of the original Vishweshwar temple.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The temple to Lord Shiva</h4>
<ul>
<li>For more than 100 years after the mosque was built, there was no temple at the site.</li>
<li>The present Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built in the 18th century by Rani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, immediately to the south of the mosque.</li>
<li>Over the decades it emerged as one of the most prominent and revered centres of the Hindu religion.</li>
<li>Many Hindus have long believed that the original deity of the erstwhile Vishweshwar temple was hidden by the priests inside the Gyanvapi well during Aurangzeb’s raid.</li>
<li>This has fired the desire to conduct puja and rituals at the sacred place where the mosque now stands.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Longstanding claims</h4>
<ul>
<li>From time to time, petitioners have laid claim to the mosque, saying it remains the original sacred place of Hindu worship.</li>
<li>The Ayodhya movement also aimed to “liberate” the Kashi-Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi mosque site and the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What laws restrict such acts?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 — which mandates that the nature of all places of worship, except the one in Ayodhya that was then under litigation, shall be maintained as it was on August 15, 1947.</li>
<li>It maintains that no encroachment of any such place prior to the date can be challenged in courts — applies to the disputed complex in Varanasi.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What was the case before the Court?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The temple worshipers side had argued that the mosque was built on the site of an older temple, while the another side pleaded that the mosque was built on Wakf premises.</li>
<li>The plea also said that <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/sc-takes-up-pleas-against-places-of-worship-act/">The Places of Worship Act of 1991</a> barred the changing of the character of the mosque.</li>
<li>The case was initially heard by the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Varanasi, but it was transferred by the Supreme Court to the District Judge on grounds of the “complexity of the issues involved in the civil suit”.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court said it would wait for the district court’s decision on the mosque committee’s application before intervening in the matter.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issue in Limelight</h4>
<ul>
<li>In April 2021, Fast Track Court Civil Judge ordered the Archaeological Survey of India to get a comprehensive archaeological physical survey” done of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Mosque complex.</li>
<li>It was tasked to find out as to whether the religious structure standing at present at the disputed site is a superimposition, alteration or addition or there is a structural overlapping of any kind, with or over, any religious structure.</li>
<li>The mosque is not an ASI-protected site, and the ASI has no role in its maintenance or upkeep.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the people seeking now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Worshippers find the <strong><u>cut-off date of August 15, 1947, is “arbitrary, irrational and retrospective</u></strong>” and prohibits Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs from approaching courts to “reclaim” their places of worship.</li>
<li>Such places, they argue, were “<strong><u>invaded” and “encroached” upon by “fundamentalist barbaric invaders</u></strong>”.</li>
<li>Certain groups have opposed the law even when it was introduced, arguing that the Centre has no power to legislate on “pilgrimages” or “burial grounds” which are under the state list.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>GST Council</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p>The Union Finance Minister has heaped praises on Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>FM was reacting to a case made by <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/fifteenth-finance-commission/">Fifteenth Finance Commission</a> chief N.K. Singh to set up a Fiscal Council with the Centre and States.</li>
<li>This is another such recommended body to act as a bridge between the GST Council and the Finance Commission.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the GST Council?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The GST regime came into force after the 101<sup>st</sup> Constitutional Amendment was passed by both Houses of Parliament in 2016.</li>
<li>The GST Council – a joint forum of the Centre and the states — was set up by the President as per Article 279A (1) of the amended Constitution.</li>
<li>The members of the Council include the Union Finance Minister (chairperson), the Union Minister of State (Finance) from the Centre.</li>
<li>Each state can nominate a minister in-charge of finance or taxation or any other minister as a member.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why was the Council set up?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Council, according to Article 279, is meant to “make recommendations to the Union and the states on important issues related to GST, like the goods and services that may be subjected or exempted from GST, model GST Laws”.</li>
<li>It also decides on various rate slabs of GST.</li>
<li>For instance, an interim report by a panel of ministers has suggested imposing 28 per cent GST on casinos, online gaming and horse racing.</li>
<li>A decision on this will be taken at the Council meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recent reforms</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ongoing meeting is the first since a decision of the Supreme Court in May this year, which stated <strong><u>recommendations of the GST Council are not binding</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The court said Article 246A of the Constitution gives both <strong><u>Parliament and state legislatures “simultaneous” power to legislate on GST</u></strong> .</li>
<li>Recommendations of the Council are the product of a collaborative dialogue involving the Union and States.</li>
<li><strong><u>This was hailed by some states</u></strong>, such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, who believe states can be more flexible in accepting the recommendations as suited to them.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Essential Medicines</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Not Much</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-635839" height="216" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nlem-300x155.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nlem-300x155.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nlem.jpg 613w" width="418"/></p>
<p>The latest National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) released September 13, 2022 by the Union health ministry added 34 new medicines and dropped 26 old ones from the previous list.</p>
<h4>What is NLEM?</h4>
<ul>
<li>As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), Essential Medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population.</li>
<li>Ministry of Health and Family Welfare hence prepared and released the first National List of Essential Medicines of India in 1996 consisting of 279 medicines.</li>
<li>The list is made with consideration to disease prevalence, efficacy, safety and comparative cost-effectiveness of the medicines.</li>
<li>Such medicines are intended to be available in adequate amounts, in appropriate dosage forms and strengths with assured quality.</li>
<li>They should be available in such a way that an individual or community can afford.</li>
</ul>
<h4>NLEM in India</h4>
<ul>
<li>Drugs listed under NLEM — also known as scheduled drugs — will be cheaper because the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-the-nppas-role-in-fixing-drug-prices/">National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA)</a> caps medicine prices and changes only based on wholesale price index-based inflation.</li>
<li>The list includes anti-infectives medicines to treat diabetes such as insulin — HIV, tuberculosis, cancer, contraceptives, hormonal medicines and anaesthetics.</li>
<li>They account for 17-18 per cent of the estimated Rs 1.6-trillion domestic pharmaceutical market.</li>
<li>Companies selling non-scheduled drugs can hike prices by up to 10 per cent every year.</li>
<li>Typically, once NLEM is released, the department of pharmaceuticals under the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers adds them in the Drug Price Control Order, after which NPPA fixes the price.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Significance of EML</h4>
<ul>
<li>Drawing an essential medicines list (EML) is expected to result in better quality of medical care, better management of medicines and cost-effective use of health care resources.</li>
<li>This is especially important for a resource limited country like India.</li>
<li>The list of essential medicines is intended to have a positive impact on the availability and rational use of medicines.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>NA</p></div></div><p><img alt="Arattupuzha" class="alignnone wp-image-635838" height="409" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/atrap-200x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/atrap-200x300.jpg 200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/atrap-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/atrap.jpg 720w" width="272"/></p>
<p>A recently-released Malayalam film Pathonpatham Noottandu (‘Nineteenth Century’) is based on the life of Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker, a social reformer from the Ezhava community in Kerala who lived in the 19th century.</p>
<h4>Who was Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Born into a well-off family of merchants in Kerala’s Alappuzha district, Panicker was one of the most influential figures in the reformation movement in the state.</li>
<li>He challenged the domination of upper castes or ‘Savarnas’ and brought about changes in the lives of both men and women.</li>
<li>The social reform movement in Kerala in the 19th century led to the large-scale subversion of the existing caste hierarchy and social order in the state.</li>
<li>Panicker was murdered by a group of upper-caste men in 1874 at the age of 49. This makes him the ‘first martyr’ of the Kerala renaissance.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What was Panicker’s role in initiating social reforms?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Panicker is credited with building two temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, in which members of all castes and religions were allowed entry.</li>
<li>One was built in his own village Arattupuzha in 1852, and one in Thanneermukkom in 1854, another village in the Alappuzha district.</li>
<li>Some of his most significant contributions were in protesting for the rights of women belonging to Kerala’s backward communities.</li>
<li>In 1858, he led the Achippudava Samaram strike at Kayamkulam in Alappuzha.</li>
<li>This strike aimed to earn women belonging to oppressed groups the right to wear a lower garment that extended beyond the knees.</li>
<li>In 1859, this was extended into the Ethappu Samaram, the struggle for the right to wear an upper body cloth by women belonging to backward castes.</li>
<li>In 1860, he led the Mukkuthi Samaram at Pandalam in the Pathanamthitta district, for the rights of lower-caste women to wear ‘mukkuthi’ or nose-ring, and other gold ornaments.</li>
<li>These struggles played an important role in challenging the social order and in raising the dignity of women belonging to the lower strata of society in public life.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other work</h4>
<ul>
<li>Apart from issues related to women, Panicker also led the first-ever strike by agricultural labourers in Kerala, the Karshaka Thozhilali Samaram, which was successful.</li>
<li>He also established the first Kathakali Yogam for the Ezhava community in 1861, which led to a Kathakali performance by Ezhavas and other backward communities, another first for them.</li>

<p>Maharashtra’s Deputy Chief Minister and other leaders are in Moscow to unveil the statue of Lok Shahir (balladeer) Annabhau Sathe at the All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sathe’s work was immensely inspired by the Russian revolution and the Communist ideology.</li>
<li>He was a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI), and featured among the selected authors from India whose work was translated in Russian.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who was Anna bhau Sathe?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tukaram Bhaurao Sathe, who later came to be known as Annabhau Sathe, was born in a Dalit family on August 1, 1920 in Maharashtra’s Wategaon village in Satara district.</li>
<li>In 1930, his family left the village and came to Mumbai. Here, he worked as a porter, a hawker and even a cotton mill helper.</li>
<li>In 1934, Mumbai witnessed a workers’ strike under the leadership of Lal Bawta Mill Workers Union in which he participated.</li>
<li>During his days at the Matunga Labour Camp, he got to know R B More, an associate of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar in the famous ‘Chavdar Lake’ satyagraha at Mahad, and joined the labour study circle.</li>
<li>Being a Dalit, he was denied schooling in his village. It was during these study circles that he learned to read and write.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did Anna start writing songs, ballads and books?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sathe wrote his first poem on the menace of mosquitoes in the labour camp.</li>
<li>He formed Dalit Yuvak Sangh, a cultural group and started writing poems on workers’ protests, agitations.</li>
<li>The group used to perform in front of the mill gates.</li>
<li>Progressive Writers Association was formed at the national level at the same time with the likes of Premchand, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Manto, Ismat Chugtai, Rahul Sankrutyayan, Mulkraj Anand as its members.</li>
<li>The group would translate the Russian work of Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov, Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev into Marathi, which Sathe got hooked on.</li>
<li>It not only had an ideological impact on him, but inspired him to write street plays, stories, novels etc. In 1939, he wrote his first ballad ‘Spanish Povada’.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How popular was his work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sathe and his group travelled across Mumbai campaigning for workers’ rights.</li>
<li>Out of the 49 years that he lived, Sathe, who began writing only after the age of 20, churned out 32 novels, 13 collections of short stories, four plays, a travelogue and 11 <strong><u>povadas (ballads).</u></strong></li>
<li>Several of his works like ‘<strong><u>Aklechi Goshta</u></strong>,’ ‘<strong><u>Stalingradacha Povada</u></strong>,’ ‘<strong><u>Mazi Maina Gavavar Rahili</u></strong>,’ ‘<strong><u>Jag Badal Ghaluni Ghav’</u></strong> were popular across the state.</li>
<li>Almost six of his novels were turned into films and many translated into other languages, including Russian.</li>
<li>His ‘<strong><u>Bangalchi Hak’ </u></strong>(Bengal’s Call) on the Bengal famine was translated into Bengali and later presented at London’s Royal Theatre.</li>
<li>His literature depicted the caste and class reality of Indian society of that time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Left leanings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sathe’s work was influenced by Marxism, but at the same time he brought out the harsh realities of the caste system.</li>
<li>In 1943, he formed the Lal Bawta Kala Pathak.</li>
<li>The group toured across Maharashtra presenting programmes on caste atrocities, class conflict, and workers’ rights.</li>
<li>He dedicated his most famous novel Fakira to Dr Ambedkar.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What was his Russian connection?</h4>
<ul>
<li>He was once called the <strong><u>Maxim Gorky of Maharashtra</u></strong>.</li>
<li>He was immensely inspired by <strong><u>Gorky’s ‘The Mother’</u></strong> and the Russian revolution, which was reflected in his writings.</li>
<li>He travelled to Russia in 1961 along with a group of other Indians.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is there a reason behind the statue being unveiled now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sathe belonged to the Matang community among Dalits.</li>
<li>With the Left failing to claim his artistic legacy, Sathe is now restricted as a symbol of a particular community.</li>
<li>The right wing is angling to claim the credit for making Sathe a global icon.</li>
<li>Installing Sathe’s oil painting at the Indian consulate at Moscow also shows that the central government is using this occasion to increase cultural dialogue between two countries.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Increasing the efficiency of processing patent applications and wider academia-industry collaboration are crucial steps for patent system.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is patent system? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A patent system is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publishing an enabling disclosure of the invention.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why are patents important?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A patent is important because it can help safeguard our invention. It can protect any product, design or process that meets certain specifications according to its originality, practicality, suitability, and utility. In most cases, a patent can protect an invention for up to 20 years.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="patent system" class="alignnone wp-image-635779" height="309" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/patent_0-1-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/patent_0-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/patent_0-1.jpg 724w" width="464"/>How to get patent? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application.</li>
<li>The patent owner may give permission to, or license, other parties to use the invention on mutually agreed terms.</li>
<li>The owner may also sell the right to the invention to someone else, who will then become the new owner of the patent.</li>
<li>Once a patent expires, the protection ends, and an invention enters the public domain; that is, anyone can commercially exploit the invention without infringing the patent.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/diluting-of-patent-working-discloser-rule-and-its-implications-for-compulsory-license-regime/"><strong>Terms of Patent</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patents may be granted for inventions in any field of technology, from an everyday kitchen utensil to a nanotechnology chip.</li>
<li>An invention can be a product – such as a chemical compound, or a process, for example – or a process for producing a specific chemical compound.</li>
<li>Patent protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years from the filing date of the application.</li>
<li>Patents are territorial rights. In general, the exclusive rights are only applicable in the country or region in which a patent has been filed and granted, in accordance with the law of that country or region.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="patent system" class="alignnone wp-image-635780" height="295" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/images-2.jpeg" width="496"/>How patents can support inventors and improve lives</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize and reward</strong>: Patents recognize and reward inventors for their commercially-successful inventions. As such they serve as an incentive for inventors to invent. With a patent, an inventor or small business knows there is a good chance that they will get a return on the time, effort and money they invested in developing a technology. In sum, it means they can earn a living from their work.</li>
<li><strong>Economic opportunity</strong>: When a new technology comes onto the market, society as a whole stands to benefit – both directly, because it may enable us to do something that was previously not possible, and indirectly in terms of the economic opportunities (business development and employment) that can flow from it.</li>
<li><strong>Research and development (R&amp;D): </strong>The revenues generated from commercially successful patent-protected technologies make it possible to finance further technological research and development (R&amp;D), thereby improving the chances of even better technology becoming available in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities for business growth</strong>: A patent effectively turns an inventor’s know-how into a commercially tradeable asset, opening up opportunities for business growth and job creation through licensing and joint ventures, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Commercialization of a technology</strong>: Holding a patent also makes a small business more attractive to investors who play a key role in enabling the commercialization of a technology.</li>
<li><strong>Spark new ideas</strong>: The technical information and business intelligence generated by the patenting process can spark new ideas and promote new inventions from which we can all benefit and which may, in turn, qualify for patent protection.</li>
<li><strong>No freebies</strong>: A patent can help stop unscrupulous third parties from free riding on the efforts of the inventor.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is KAPILA Initiative?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full form</strong>: KAPILA is an acronym for Kalam Program for IP (Intellectual Property) Literacy and Awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Guidelines for patent</strong> <strong>Filing: </strong>Under this campaign, students pursuing education in higher educational institutions will get information about the correct system of the application process for patenting their invention and they will be aware of their rights.</li>
<li><strong>Encouragement to students</strong>: The program will facilitate the colleges and institutions to encourage more and more students to file patents.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Thing to remember </strong></p>
<p>Remember one thing, ‘KAPILA’ Program is related to IP awareness. It sounds much like an animal husbandry related initiative.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Way ahead </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As the patent system is a critical aspect of the national innovation ecosystem, investing in the patent ecosystem will help in strengthening the innovation capability of India.</li>
<li>The right interventions should be made for the promotion of the quality of patent applications and collaboration between academia and industry.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>A patent can help stop unscrupulous third parties from free riding on the efforts of the inventor. Discuss this statement in context of protection of innovative ecosystem in India.</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data shows anaemia rates increased from 53 per cent to 57 per cent in women and 58 per cent to 67 per cent in children in 2019-21.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Definition of anaemia </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The WHO defines anaemia as a condition where the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. This compromises immunity and impedes cognitive development.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why anaemia is a concern?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Adverse effects of anaemia affect all age groups lower physical and cognitive growth and alertness among children and adolescents, and lesser capacity to learn and play, directly impacting their future potential as productive citizens.</li>
<li>Anaemia among adolescent girls (59.1 per cent) advances to maternal anaemiaand is a major cause of maternal and infant mortality and general morbidity and ill health in a community.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What causes anaemia?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imbalanced diet</strong>: Cereal-centric diets, with relatively less consumption of iron-rich food groups like meat, fish, eggs, and dark green leafy vegetables (DGLF), can be associated with higher levels of anaemia.</li>
<li><strong>Underlying factors</strong>: High levels of anaemia are also often associated with underlying factors like poor water quality and sanitation conditions that can adversely impact iron absorption in the body.</li>
<li><strong>Iron deficiency is major cause</strong>: A diet that does not contain enough iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 is a common cause of anaemia.</li>
<li><strong>Some other conditions</strong>: That may lead to anaemia include pregnancy, heavy periods, blood disorders or cancer, inherited disorders, and infectious diseases.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="anaemia" class="alignnone wp-image-635793" height="361" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indian-women_simon-williams-ekta-parishad_wiki-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indian-women_simon-williams-ekta-parishad_wiki-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Indian-women_simon-williams-ekta-parishad_wiki.jpg 750w" width="542"/>Why is anaemia so high in the country?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low vitamin intake</strong>: Iron-deficiency and vitamin B12-deficiency anaemia are the two common types of anaemia in India.</li>
<li><strong>High population and nutrition deprivation</strong>: Among women, iron deficiency prevalence is higher than men due to menstrual iron losses and the high iron demands of a growing foetus during pregnancies.</li>
<li><strong>Overemphasis on cereals</strong>: Lack of millets in the diet due to overdependence on rice and wheat, insufficient consumption of green and leafy vegetables could be the reasons behind the high prevalence of anaemia in India.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is</strong> <strong>Iron fortification?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Iron fortification of food is a methodology utilized worldwide to address iron deficiency. Iron fortification programs usually involve mandatory, centralized mass fortification of staple foods, such as wheat flour.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/mandatory-rice-fortification-policy-should-be-re-examined/" class="alignnone wp-image-635795" height="593" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0da17f852d10621c79c6d4a1935af0fa-215x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0da17f852d10621c79c6d4a1935af0fa-215x300.jpg 215w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0da17f852d10621c79c6d4a1935af0fa.jpg 500w" width="425"/>Why need iron fortification?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Iron deficiency anaemia is due to insufficient iron.</li>
<li>Without enough iron, the body can’t produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (haemoglobin).</li>
<li>Severe anaemia during pregnancy increases risk of premature birth, having a low birth weight baby and postpartum depression. Some studies also show an increased risk of infant death immediately before or after birth.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Nepal’s success story to improve maternal anaemia by national action plan .</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/mandatory-rice-fortification-policy-should-be-re-examined/"><strong>Anaemia Mukt Bharat</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The scheme aims to reduce the prevalence of anaemia in India.</li>
<li>It provides bi weekly iron Folic acid supplementation to all under five children through Asha workers.</li>
<li>Also, it provides biannual Deworming for children and adolescents. The scheme also establishes institutional mechanisms for advanced research in anaemia.</li>
<li>It also focuses on non-nutritional causes of anaemia.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>We need to focus on the following interventions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Prophylactic Iron and Folic Acid supplementation.</li>
<li>Intensified year-round Behaviour Change Communication Campaign (Solid Body, Smart Mind).</li>
<li>Appropriate infant and young child feeding practices.</li>
<li>Increase in intake of iron-rich food through diet diversity/quantity/frequency and/or fortified foods with focus on harnessing locally available resources.</li>
<li>Testing and treatment of anaemia, using digital methods and point of care treatment, with special focus on pregnant women and school-going adolescents</li>
<li>Mandatory provision of Iron and Folic Acid fortified foods in government-funded public health programmes</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s nutrition programmes must undergo a periodic review.</li>
<li>The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), which is perceived as the guardian of the nation’s nutritional well-being must reassess itself and address critical intervention gaps, both conceptually and programmatically, and produce rapid outcomes.</li>
<li>The nutritional deficit which ought to be considered an indicator of great concern is generally ignored by policymakers and experts. Unless this is addressed, rapid improvement in nutritional indicators cannot happen.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>When a person is anaemic, the capacity of his blood cells to carry oxygen decreases. This reduces the productivity of the person which in turn affects the economy of the country. Therefore, it is highly important to cover Anaemia under National Health Mission.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Windfall taxes</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p><strong><img alt="windfall" class="alignnone wp-image-635835" height="274" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/windfall-300x210.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/windfall-300x210.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/windfall-768x536.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/windfall.jpg 945w" width="391"/></strong></p>
<p>Finance Minister has defended the windfall tax imposed by the Centre on domestic crude oil producers, saying that it was not an ad hoc move but was done after full consultation with the industry.</p>
<h4>What is a Windfall Tax?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Windfall taxes are designed to tax the profits a company derives from an external, sometimes unprecedented event — for instance, the energy price-rise as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</li>
<li>These are profits that cannot be attributed to something the firm actively did, like an investment strategy or an expansion of business.</li>
<li>The US Congressional Research Service (CRS) defines a windfall as an “unearned, unanticipated gain in income through no additional effort or expense”.</li>
<li>One area where such taxes have routinely been discussed is oil markets, where price fluctuation leads to volatile or erratic profits for the industry.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When did India introduce this?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In July this year, India announced a windfall tax on domestic crude oil producers who it believed were reaping the benefits of the high oil prices.</li>
<li>It also imposed an additional excise levy on diesel, petrol and air turbine fuel (ATF) exports.</li>
<li>Also, India’s case was different from other countries, as it was still importing discounted Russian oil.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is it levied?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Governments typically levy this as a <strong><u>one-off tax retrospectively</u></strong> over and above the normal rates of tax.</li>
<li>The Central government has introduced a windfall profit tax of ₹23,250 per tonne on domestic crude oil production, which was subsequently revised fortnightly four times so far.</li>
<li>The latest revision was on August 31, when it was hiked to ₹13,300 per tonne from ₹13,000.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why govt. introduced windfall tax?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There have been varying rationales for governments worldwide to introduce windfall taxes like:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Redistribution of unexpected gains when high prices benefit producers at the expense of consumers,</li>
<li>Funding social welfare schemes, and</li>
<li>Supplementary revenue stream for the government</li>
</ol>
<h4>Why are countries levying windfall taxes now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prices of oil, gas, and coal have seen <strong><u>sharp increases</u></strong> since last year and in the first two quarters of the current year, although they have reduced recently.</li>
<li><strong><u>Pandemic recovery</u></strong> and supply issues resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict <strong><u>shored up energy demands</u></strong>, which in turn have driven up global prices.</li>
<li>The rising prices meant huge and record profits for energy companies while resulting in <strong><u>hefty gas and electricity bills for households</u></strong> in major and smaller economies.</li>
<li>Since the gains stemmed partly from external change, multiple analysts have called them windfall profits.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with imposing such taxes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Companies are confident in investing in a sector if there is <strong><u>certainty and stability in a tax regime</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Since windfall taxes are imposed retrospectively and are often influenced by unexpected events, they can brew <strong><u>uncertainty in the market about future taxes</u></strong>.</li>
<li>IMF says that taxes in response to price surges <strong><u>may suffer from design problems</u></strong>—given their expedient and <strong><u>political nature</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It added that introducing a temporary windfall profit tax <strong><u>reduces future investment</u></strong> because prospective investors will internalise the likelihood of potential taxes when making investment decisions.</li>
<li>There is another argument about what exactly constitutes true windfall profits; how can it be determined and <strong><u>what level of profit is normal or excessive</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Another issue is<strong> <u>who should be taxed</u></strong> — only the big companies responsible for the bulk of high-priced sales or smaller companies as well— raising the question of whether producers with revenues or profits below a certain threshold should be exempt.</li>
</ul>

<li>Afghanistan is not invited</li>
<li>Leaders of guest countries -Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Turkmenistan</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is non- alignment?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It’s a policy, a brainchild of Nehru. Non-alignment movement emerged after second world war.</li>
<li>Non-alignment means not having an alliance with any of superpower, either USSR or USA.  Decolonized nations of Asia and Africa was largely a part of this group.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Multi alignment" class="alignnone wp-image-635813" height="487" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Stevan_Kragujevic_Tito_Naser_Nehru_Dolazak_na_Brione-277x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Stevan_Kragujevic_Tito_Naser_Nehru_Dolazak_na_Brione-277x300.jpg 277w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Stevan_Kragujevic_Tito_Naser_Nehru_Dolazak_na_Brione.jpg 440w" width="450"/>India’s policy of non-alignment </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>At bandung conference in 1955 non-alignment movement started with India as one of the founding member.</li>
<li>With policy of non-alignment India refused to gravitate towards USA or USSR.</li>
<li>India was the leader of non-alignment.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is India’s current policy of multi- alignment? Advantages and challenges.</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the start of his tenure from 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi have not attended any conference of non-alignment.</li>
<li>External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar in his book, The Indian way have criticized the non-alignment.</li>
<li>In the words of Former Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale India is no longer the non-align nation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How it is a Multi alignment policy?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India to truly multi aligned or all aligned by being a part of every major grouping.</li>
<li>India is a part of BRICS and Prime Minister Modi is attending the SCO SUMMIT in Samarkand.</li>
<li>On parallel to rival groups India is also the part of Quad and Indo pacific economic framework.</li>
<li>India is buying the discounted Russian oil and reusing to buckle under pressure from west and USA.</li>
<li>S-400 purchase is happening and India have dodged the bullet of sanctions from USA.</li>
<li>India is choosing the bilateral Free trade agreement like with Australia and UAE and withdrew from groupings like RCEP and Most recently IPEF. This policy are is said to be in the economic interest of India.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Advantages of Multi alignment </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India no longer wants to repeat the mistake of missing out of P5 Security council (“Permanent membership in the Security Council was granted to five states based on their importance in the aftermath of World War II).</li>
<li>If any group work against your interest it is better to be part of group rather than remain outside and do nothing</li>
<li>With retreating USA and its collapsing hegemony world is moving towards multiple polar world order.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Disadvantages </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Major disadvantage of non-alignment is you no longer have influence over adverse policy of friendly country.</li>
<li>For example. Russia sells S-400 to India but it also sold the same weapon to china.</li>
<li>USA and India are strategically getting closer day by day but USA recently approved the sale of $450 million F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Multi alignment will serve India its best national interest.</li>
<li>So far India has managed the rival parties at world stage to secure its foreign policy objectives but with Russian aggression and Chinese assertion and divided world will pose a significant challenge to India’s multi alignment policy.</li>
</ul>
