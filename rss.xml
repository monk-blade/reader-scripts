<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>One Nation One Fertiliser (ONOF)</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>India's fertilizer subsidy</p></div></div><p>The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers will implement One Nation One Fertiliser (ONOF) by introducing a Single Brand for Fertilisers and Logo under the fertiliser subsidy scheme named “Pradhanmantri Bhartiya Janurvarak Pariyojna” (PMBJP).</p>
<h4>One Nation One Fertiliser (ONOF)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The single brand name for UREA, DAP, MOP and NPK etc. would be BHARAT UREA, BHARAT DAP, BHARAT MOP and BHARAT NPK etc. respectively for all Fertiliser Companies, State Trading Entities (STEs) and Fertiliser Marketing Entities (FMEs).</li>
<li>Also a logo indicating Fertiliser subsidy scheme namely Pradhanmantri Bhartiya Janurvarak Pariyojna will be used on said fertiliser bags.</li>
<li>Under the scheme, companies are allowed to display their name, brand, logo and other relevant product information only on one-third space of their bags.</li>
<li>On the remaining two-thirds space, the “Bharat” brand and Pradhanmantri Bharatiya Jan Urvarak Pariyojana logo will have to be shown.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the government’s argument for introducing this scheme?</h4>
<p>The government’s logic for introducing a <strong><u>single ‘Bharat’ brand</u></strong> for all subsidised fertilisers being marketed by companies is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Subsidies normalization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum retail price of urea is currently fixed by the government, which compensates companies for the higher cost of manufacturing or imports incurred by them.</li>
<li>The MRPs of non-urea fertilisers are, on paper, decontrolled.</li>
<li>But companies cannot avail of subsidy if they sell at MRPs higher than that informally indicated by the government.</li>
<li>Simply put, there are some 26 fertilisers (inclusive of urea), on which government bears subsidy and also effectively decides the MRPs;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Harmonizing markets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from subsidising and deciding at what price companies can sell, the government also decides where they can sell.</li>
<li>This is done through the Fertiliser (Movement) Control Order, 1973.</li>
<li>Under this, the department of fertilisers draws an agreed monthly supply plan on all subsidised fertilisers in consultation with manufacturers and importers.</li>
<li>This supply plan is issued before the 25th of each month for the following month, with the department also regularly monitoring movement to ensure fertiliser availability as per requirement, including remote areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Farmers welfare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government is spending vast sums of money on fertiliser subsidy (the bill is likely to cross Rs 200,000 crore in 2022-23).</li>
<li>By deciding where and at what price companies can sell, it would obviously want to take credit and send that message to farmers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What can be the drawbacks of the scheme?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It may <strong><u>disincentivise fertiliser companies</u></strong> from undertaking marketing and brand promotion activities.</li>
<li>They will now be <strong><u>reduced to contract manufacturers</u></strong> and importers for the government. Any company’s strength ultimately is its brands and farmer trust built over decades.</li>
<li>Currently, in case of any bag or batch of fertilisers not meeting the required standards, the <strong><u>blame is put on the company</u>. </strong>But now, that may be passed on fully to the government.</li>
<li>Politically, the scheme might well boomerang rather than benefit the ruling party.</li>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>EODB</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>EODB in India</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-628299" height="270" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ease-of-doing-300x157.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ease-of-doing-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ease-of-doing.jpg 574w" width="516"/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-ease-of-doing-business-in-india/">Ease of doing business in India</a> remains low, dragged down by the way contracts are enforced in the country. Recent reforms have improved the business climate somewhat, but there is a long way to go.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Ease of Doing Business index?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an index designed by the World Bank to rank 190 economies.</li>
<li>A higher rank (closer to 1) means the country’s regulatory environment is favourable to business operations.</li>
<li>India was ranked 63rd in the overall index in 2020.</li>
<li>World Bank has now discontinued the Doing Business index.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Indicators used</h4>
<p>The ranking is calculated on the basis of indicators such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting a Business</li>
<li>Dealing with Construction Permits</li>
<li>Getting Electricity</li>
<li>Registering Property</li>
<li>Getting Credit</li>
<li>Protecting Minority Investors, Paying Taxes</li>
<li>Trading across Borders</li>
<li>Enforcing Contracts and</li>
<li>Resolving Insolvency</li>
</ol>
<h4>How is ‘Enforcing Contracts’ measured?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, in the parameter of ‘Enforcing Contracts’, India was ranked 163rd, against 186th in 2015. The parameter considers time, cost and quality of the judicial process.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Time considers the number of days to resolve a commercial dispute in courts;</li>
<li>Cost measures the expenses of attorney, courts and enforcement as a percentage of claim value; and</li>
<li>Quality considers the use of best practices which can promote efficiency and quality i.e., court proceedings, case management, alternative dispute resolution and court automation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Each of the three indicators have a 33.3% weightage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is India doing on this parameter now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>At 163rd position in 2020, the country continues to struggle, with the time taken to resolve a commercial dispute being approximately 1,445 days in the Doing Business Report 2020.</li>
<li>However, as of August 2022, law ministry data shows a marked improvement of close to 50% in days taken to resolve a dispute to 744 days in New Delhi and 626 days in Mumbai.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are some of the reforms undertaken?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Justice, the nodal point for ‘Enforcing Contracts’ indicator along with the eCommittee of the Supreme Court, has undertaken a series of reforms.</li>
<li>Some of the steps include <strong><u>the establishment of dedicated commercial courts</u></strong> with monetary jurisdiction up to ₹3 lakh.</li>
<li>There also exists online case filing, e-payment of court fees, electronic case management, special courts for infrastructure project contracts, as well as automatic and random allocation of commercial cases thereby eliminating human intervention.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What further steps are required?</h4>
<ul>
<li>An <strong><u>efficient judiciary</u></strong> instils confidence in investors and signals the commercial viability of transactions.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>number of court hearings</u></strong> <strong><u>should be minimized</u></strong> too; often, lawyers have an incentive to stretch out the process.</li>
<li>The judicial system should encourage <strong><u>out-of-court settlements</u></strong> through the respective lawyers as practised in advanced countries.</li>
<li>It is equally important that the judiciary leaves matters relating to <strong><u>economic governance</u></strong> to governments.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Special Marriage Act, 1954</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Issues with inter-faith marriage</p></div></div><p>The Supreme Court has dismissed a writ petition challenging the Constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 under which couples seek refuge for inter-faith and inter-caste marriages.</p>
<h4>What is Special Marriage Act, 1954?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Special Marriage Act, 1954 (SMA) was enacted to facilitate the marriage of couples professing different faiths, and preferring a civil wedding.</li>
<li>However, some practical problems arise in registering such marriages.</li>
<li>The law’s features on prior public notice being given and objections for the safety and privacy of those intending to marry across religions.</li>
<li>To overcome this, many settle for marriage under the personal law of one of them, with the other opting for religious conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What does the petition seek?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court dismissed a writ petition challenging the Constitutional validity of certain provisions of the SMA under which couples seek refuge for inter-faith and inter-caste marriages.</li>
<li>The writ petition has called these provisions <strong><u>violative of Article 21</u></strong>, which guarantees the right to privacy.</li>
<li>Under this act, the couples require to give a notice of 30 days before the date of marriage inviting objections from the public.</li>
<li>The provisions <strong><u>contravene Article 14</u></strong> on prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste and sex as well as <strong><u>Article 15</u></strong> on right to equality as these requirements are absent in personal laws.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What did the court say?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The SC Bench rejected the writ petition on the grounds that the petitioner was no longer an aggrieved party as she had already solemnised her marriage under SMA.</li>
<li>The petitioner’s lawyers said that they were now deliberating on an alternative approach to initiate this litigation such as through a public interest litigation involving other victims.</li>
<li>Another writ petition is admitted by the Supreme Court in 2020 and the government’s reply to is awaited.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the provisions that have been challenged?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Section 5 of the SMA requires couples getting married under it to give a <strong><u>notice to the Marriage Officer</u></strong> 30 days before the date of marriage.</li>
<li>Section 6 requires such a notice to be then entered into the Marriage Notice Book maintained by the Marriage Officer, which can be <strong><u>inspected by any person desirous</u></strong> of inspecting the same.</li>
<li>These notices have to be also <strong><u>affixed at a “conspicuous place”</u></strong> in the office of the Marriage Officer so that anyone can raise an objection to the marriage.</li>
<li>Section 7 provides the process for making an objection such as if either party has a living spouse, is incapable of <strong><u>giving consent due to “unsoundness of mind</u></strong>” or is suffering from mental disorder resulting in the person being unfit for marriage or procreation.</li>
<li>Section 8 specifies the <strong><u>inquiry procedure to be followed after an objection</u></strong> has been submitted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why are these provisions contentious?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The provisions throw the <strong><u>personal information</u></strong> of the individuals <strong><u>open to public scrutiny</u></strong>. This may result into <strong><u>vigilantism</u></strong>.</li>
<li>This seriously damages one’s <strong><u>right to have control over her or his personal information</u></strong> and its accessibility.</li>
<li>By making the personal details of the couple accessible to everyone, the very <strong><u>right of the couple to be the decision makers of their marriage </u></strong>is being hampered by the state.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do these provisions make couples vulnerable?</h4>
<ul>
<li>These public notices have been used by <strong><u>anti-social elements to harass couples</u></strong> getting married.</li>
<li>For many who often marry without their parent’s consent this <strong><u>can be life-threatening</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Many states <strong><u>publicly share the details</u></strong> of couples marrying under SMA on their websites.</li>
<li>Many also complain about the <strong><u>behaviour of the staff at the SDM’s office</u></strong> who often delete or delay applications and dissuade couples from marrying under SMA.</li>
<li>With as many as 11 States passing <strong><u><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/mains/q-1-discuss-the-rationale-behind-anti-conversion-laws-in-india-also-state-the-concerns-that-have-been-raised-with-regard-to-these-laws-10-marks/">anti-conversion</a> (or so-called love-jihad) laws</u></strong>, parents and the State are now armed to <strong><u>punish and harass such couples.</u></strong></li>

<ul>
<li>An agricultural labourer died by suicide every 2 hours in 2021: NCRB</li>
<li>The national catastrophe of farmer suicide since the 1990s, often by drinking pesticides is attributed to their inability to repay loans mostly taken from landlords and banks.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>NCRB Stats on Farmers Suicide</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Some 5,563 agricultural labourers died by suicide in 2021, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The number of suicides increased by nine per cent from 2020 and by around 29 per cent from 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Causes of Farmers Suicide</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non sustainable cropping</strong>: Most of the suicides have occurred in areas of cash crops like cotton and sugarcane, which is high input, high output gambling, not based on the principle of sustained and resilient high yield.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple causes</strong>: There is no consensus on what the main causes might be but studies show farmer suicide victims are motivated by more than one cause however the primer reasons being the inability to repay loans.</li>
<li><strong>Combined causes</strong>: Major causes reportedly are bankruptcy/indebtedness, problems in the families, crop failure, illness and alcohol/substance abuse.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Low penetration of irrigation</strong>: Irrigation reaches less than half of India’s overall farmland, a picture that has not changed much over the past decade, and more than 60% of our farmers are susceptible to rainfall anomalies.</li>
<li><strong>Dry land farming:</strong> Rain-fed farming yields are typically less than half those of irrigated farmland.</li>
<li><strong>High input cost</strong>: Though India has caught up with global levels of fertilizer use, this is neither efficient nor environmentally sustainable. Both add to the cost of cultivation.</li>
<li><strong>Slow R&amp;D</strong>: Research on high-yielding crops has plateaued after an initial burst during the Green Revolution and farmers have to resort to patented seeds to draw more out of their scanty acres.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Information technology promises to improve weather forecasting, crop identification as well as damage control, soil health monitoring, and mapping of available water resources.</li>
<li>Improvements in marketing and logistics can significantly raise the share that cultivators get of the money people pay for their food.</li>
<li>The govt. is using technology to connect farmers to a nationwide e-market, but the states need to amend their antiquated farm produce marketing laws that have squeezed farmers’ earnings.</li>
<li>An old problem of price signals failing to adjust demand and supply may also need fixing.</li>
<li>For agricultural incomes to rise, reforms, rather than cash transfers, loan waivers and the like, are the way ahead.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Along with subsidies, increased farm profits, the focus should also be on resilience building and problem-solving skills of farming families.</li>
<li>In suicide-prone states, agricultural institutes and scientists should start distributing seeds of resilience, tolerance and contentment among farmers, suggested researchers.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>ONDC</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Online Dispute Resolution</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>Despite the rapid advancement of digital platforms on the one hand and the pervasiveness of the Internet-enabled phone on the other, small enterprises such as local <i>kirana </i>stores have not gained from this. Online purchases from “near and now” inventory from the local store remain in a digital vacuum.</p>
<h4>Online revolution in country</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased smartphone use</strong>: The rise in smartphone use fuelled by affordable data plans has catalysed an online revolution in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic accelerated digital inclusion:</strong> The novel coronavirus pandemic has further accelerated the process of digital inclusion.</li>
<li>It is now not only routine to transact online it is also common to learn online, have medical consultations online, and even resolve disputes online.</li>
<li><strong>Increased scope for innovation in digital space:</strong> These realisations have given India the opportunity to disrupt the status quo with its innovative abilities.</li>
<li>Systems such as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and Aadhaar, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission have reengineered markets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why mall and medium sided businesses have not benefited from digital revolution?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Despite the rapid advancement of digital platforms small enterprises such as local kirana stores have not gained from this.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of infrastructure:</strong> This is because, to sell on numerous platforms, sellers must <strong>maintain a separate infrastructure,</strong> which only adds costs and limits participation.</li>
<li><strong>Distinct terms and conditions of platforms:</strong> The distinct terms and conditions of each platform further limit the sellers’ flexibility.</li>
<li>Consequently, small and medium-sized businesses have lost their freedom to choose and participate in the country’s e-commerce system at their will and on their terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward: Open Network for Digital Commerce</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) of the Government of India established the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)<strong> to level the playing field</strong> by developing open e-commerce and enabling access to small businesses and dealers.</li>
<li>The ONDC began its pilot in five cities in April 2022, i.e., New Delhi, Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Bhopal and Shillong.</li>
<li>Currently, the pilot has expanded to 18 cities, and there are immediate plans to add more cities.</li>
<li>The ONDC network makes it possible for products and services from all participating e-commerce platforms to be displayed in search results across all network apps.</li>
<li>For instance, a consumer shopping for a product on an e-commerce app named “X” would also receive results from e-commerce app named “Y”, if both X and Y integrated their platforms with the ONDC.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dispute resolution through ODR</h4>
<ul>
<li>Disputes will be the obvious by-product of this e-commerce revolution.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is imperative to support this initiative with a modern-day, cost-effective, timely and high-speed dispute resolution system.</li>
<li><strong>Online Dispute Resolution, or ODR</strong> as it is popularly called, has the propensity to work alongside the incumbent setup and deliver quick, affordable and enforceable outcomes.</li>
<li>The ODR is not restricted to the use of legal mechanisms such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration in an online environment but can be tailormade for the specific use case keeping the participants in mind.</li>
<li>ODR commonly involves case management systems, integration of communication technologies such as email, SMS, WhatsApp, Interactive Voice Response, audio/video conferencing.</li>
<li>With appropriate data sets in place, it can also involve advanced automation, the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable resolutions at the same time as it would take to initiate a transaction over the network.</li>
<li>Many e-commerce companies have turned to the ODR with the realisation that in order to maximise transactions it is important to ensure a positive dispute resolution experience.</li>
<li>Adoption in India: The ODR is no more a distant dream for India as well.</li>
<li>The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated platforms in the UPI ecosystem <strong>to adopt the ODR for complaints and grievances connected to failed transactions</strong>.</li>
<li> Ingram, SEBI SCORES (or the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI COm plaints REdress System), RBI CMS (or the Reserve Bank of India Complaint Management System), MahaRERA (or the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority), MSME Samadhaan (or the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Delayed Payment Monitoring System), and RTIOnline (or the Right to Information Online) are other examples of ODR systems that are widely used in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigating litigation risks</strong>: The ODR will help mitigate litigation risk and provide valuable insights into problems faced by consumers.</li>
<li>Consumers are provided with another choice for effective redress of their grievances, thereby building trust, confidence and brand loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Advantages of ONDC</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wider choice for consumers:</strong> The ONDC achieves the dual objective of wider choice for consumers on the one hand and access to a wider consumer base for sellers on the other.</li>
<li>With India’s e-commerce industry set to reach $200 billion by 2027, this shift from a platform-centric paradigm to democratisation of the nation’s online market will catalyse the <strong>inclusion of millions of small business owners and kirana businesses.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>A dispute resolution framework that includes a customised ODR process can play a role in the network achieving its steep five-year target of adding $48 billion in gross merchandise value to India’s e-commerce market, a network of 90 crore buyers and 12 crore sellers with the least hiccups.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Paris agreement</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Climate change</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>Europe is staring at a recession and its appetite for climate action is waning.</p>
<h4>Developed countries moving away from commitment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Countries in Europe led by Germany, Austria and the Netherlands are cranking up their coal plants again.</li>
<li>Fossil fuels are making a comeback and countries are rejecting the European Union (EU)’s plan to reduce natural gas consumption by 15%. Dutch, Polish and other European farmers are protesting against emission cuts from agriculture.</li>
<li>In the U.S. too, the Senate and the Supreme Court have struck blows to climate action.</li>
<li>And in the U.S. too, prices of fuel started increasing last year, not just this year.</li>
<li>Fossil fuels are making a quiet comeback, since the strength of the U.S. is its oil and gas industry.</li>
<li>That is why we have just witnessed a ‘re-calibration’ of U.S. policy towards the Gulf.</li>
<li>Coal, oil and gas are not going anywhere in the developed world; they are, in fact, making a comeback.</li>
<li>The West had rushed to draw down on fossil fuels even before technology for renewables were in place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Global peaking issue</h4>
<ul>
<li>Article 4 of the Paris Agreement defines ‘Global Peaking’ thus: “In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim <strong>to reach global peaking</strong> of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties.”</li>
<li>The developed countries, given their historical emissions, will have to peak first.</li>
<li>That’s why the reference is to<strong> ‘global peaking’</strong> and not ‘individual peaking’.</li>
<li>From this, it logically follows that when developing country parties peak later than developed countries, they will also achieve net zero later than developed countries.</li>
<li>Consequently, it is the logical conclusion of the Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that when we consider net zero, we should only consider ‘global net zero’ and not ‘individual net zero’ for 2050.</li>
<li>The statement calls on developed countries to do a net negative on mitigation by 2050 rather than just “net zero”, if they are serious about fighting climate change.</li>
<li>In effect, the West needs to do a net minus and not just net zero.</li>
<li>Thanks to the efforts of India, the phrase used in the 2021 summit-level declarations at both G-20 and Quad is ‘global net zero’. We need to build on this understanding.</li>
<li>India stands as beacon of hope in renewables.</li>
<li>It is time for all developing countries, especially the small island developing states, to make sure that the developed world doesn’t backslide on its commitments on mitigation yet again.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward for developing countries</h4>
<ul>
<li>With countries of the developed world almost sure to renege on their 2030 Paris Agreement commitments, countries of the developing world must do everything to hold the countries of the developed world to their commitments.</li>
<li>The Western nations have already started reinterpreting the Paris Agreement and look to downgrade their commitments.</li>
<li>The concept of net zero is being cleverly misinterpreted.</li>
<li> To bring this to the attention of the Global South, India, China and eight other countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America made a cross-regional statement on ‘global net zero’ on June 7 at the UN on World Environment Day.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>COP 27 in Egypt gives us that opportunity to hold their feet to the fire. It is time for the developed world to make net minus pledges. If we don’t collectively push for it, we will be collectively pushed back.</p>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>WTO waiver</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Public Stockholding of Food issue at WTO</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>The WTO ministerial meeting in June at Geneva did precious little to address the issue of public stockholding of food.</p>
<h4>Public stockholding issue at WTO</h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s PSH policy is based on<strong> procuring food from farmers at an administered price</strong> (minimum support price or MSP), which is generally higher than the market price.</li>
<li><strong>PSH’s’ twin objectives:</strong> The PSH policy serves the twin objectives of offering remunerative prices to farmers and providing subsidised food to the underprivileged.</li>
<li><strong>Trade distortion subsidy:</strong> Under WTO law, such price support-based procurement from farmers is counted as a trade-distorting subsidy, and if given beyond the permissible limit, breaches WTO law.</li>
<li>India in the World Trade Organization (WTO) — and rightly so — has been to find a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding (PSH) of food to protect India’s food security (PSH policy).</li>
<li><strong>Peace clause:</strong> Currently, India has temporary relief due to a<strong> ‘peace clause’</strong> which bars countries from bringing legal challenges against price support-based procurement for food security purposes.</li>
<li>The WTO ministerial meeting in June at Geneva did precious little to address this issue.</li>
<li> India’s concerns about the PSH issue have been taken on board.</li>
</ul>
<h4>India’s concerns</h4>
<ul>
<li>For India, the real issue is not about maintaining adequate food stocks, which WTO rules do not prohibit, provided food is stocked by employing non-trade distorting instruments such as providing income support to farmers (cash transfers independent of crop production).</li>
<li><strong>Use of MSP:</strong> India’s concern is that it should have the policy space to hold public food stocks using the MSP, which is a price support instrument.</li>
<li>However, there is no mention of price support in the Geneva declaration.</li>
<li>India’s demand for a permanent solution to the PSH policy has acquired a new dimension.</li>
<li>India insists that it should also be <strong>allowed to export food</strong>, most notably wheat, from the pool of the foodgrain procured under the MSP.</li>
<li>However, WTO law proscribes countries from <strong>exporting foodgrain procured at subsidised prices.</strong></li>
<li>Paragraph 4 of the 2013 WTO decision on PSH for food security purposes, clearly states that countries procuring food for food-security purposes shall ensure that such procured food does not “distort trade or adversely affect the food security of other Members”.</li>
<li>The same spirit is reflected in paragraph 10 of the Geneva ministerial food security declaration, which states that countries may release surplus food stocks in the international market in accordance with WTO law.</li>
<li> However, it is very unlikely that such a request will be acceded to.</li>
<li>As per Article IX.3 of the WTO Agreement, waivers can be adopted only in “<strong>exceptional circumstances</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>Developed countries have historically opposed India’s PSH programme as they apprehend that India might divert some of its public stock to the international market, thus depressing global prices.</li>
<li>India actively pushing for exporting food from its official granaries gives fresh ammunition to the PSH solution opponents.</li>
<li>Thus,<strong> India should revisit its stand</strong> on asking for a waiver for wheat exports from its public stockholding, which, in any case, was not a part of India’s PSH policy.</li>
<li>Spending scarce negotiating capital on this issue might dilute India’s core agenda of pushing for a permanent solution for its PSH programme to attain the goal of food security and providing remunerative prices to the farmers.</li>
<li>Negotiations at the WTO require crystal clarity of the core objectives that should be relentlessly pursued.</li>
<li>Adding newer objectives and shifting goalposts might result in falling between two stools.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Instead of asking for the waiver to export wheat from public stockholding, the laudable objective of helping countries facing food crises can be accomplished by strengthening India’s commitment to the United Nations World Food Programme.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Standing Deposit Facility rate</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Dealing with economically challenging period</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>In the recent MPC meeting, the policy rate hike was widely expected, more anticipated were the MPC and the RBI Governor’s forward guidance on the trajectory of policy — on both monetary policy and liquidity instruments. So, how do we see monetary policy evolve over the rest of the year and beyond?</p>
<h4>Tightening of monetary policy</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repo rate at 5.4 per cent:</strong> In its latest meeting, the members of the monetary policy committee voted unanimously to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to<strong> 5.4 per cent.</strong></li>
<li>The repo rate was 5.15 per cent in February 2020.</li>
<li>So, in effect, the RBI’s policy has not only been normalised, but has actually tightened <strong>compared to the pre-pandemic level.</strong></li>
<li> Even the lower bound of the rate corridor, the <strong>Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate,</strong> at 5.25 per cent is now above the pre-pandemic repo rate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Forward guidance on stance</h4>
<ul>
<li>The MPS indicated the retaining the policy stance rather than shifting to “neutral”.</li>
<li>This <strong>retention of stance</strong> might be interpreted as being a bit more hawkish than “neutral”, which implies that rates might be both increased or cut, depending on economic conditions.</li>
<li>Now that policy is largely normalised, the <strong>pace of tightening</strong> is likely to moderate.</li>
<li>The urgency of aggressive rate hikes and tightening of liquidity has somewhat moderated, although risks remain.</li>
<li>RBI’s research suggests that the “real natural rate” — the rate at which policy is neither loose nor tight – is 0.8-1 per cent.</li>
<li>This operative interest rate is usually the<strong> three-month T-bill rate,</strong> which in “normal” times averages 10-15 basis points above the repo rate.</li>
<li>Considering that monetary policy is calibrated over a one-year horizon and using the RBI’s inflation forecast of 5 per cent for the first quarter of 2023-24, <strong>the “natural” repo rate will be around 5.85 per cent.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Inflation and growth conditions</h4>
<ul>
<li>The RBI’s growth projection for 2022-23 has been retained at 7.2 per cent, with growth frontloaded in the first half.</li>
<li>CPI inflation is still forecast to average 6.7 per cent.</li>
<li>Inflationary pressures are likely to wane in the second half of 2022-23, particularly if the recent drop in industrial metals prices persists over the next few months.</li>
<li>A more or less normal monsoon might help in keeping food prices stable. However, risks remain.</li>
<li><strong>Robust growth prospects</strong>: Demand for consumption goods seems to be resilient, enabling some further pass-through of input costs.</li>
<li>Combine this with tight labour markets and rising wage costs in some tech-oriented sectors.</li>
<li>High frequency indicators of economic activity have recovered after some weakness in June.</li>
<li>In addition to resilient demand, there is evidence of a closing of the “output gap”.</li>
<li><strong>Global growth:</strong> Global growth and trade are forecast to significantly slow down in 2022 and 2023, largely due<strong> to aggressive tightening by G-10 central banks</strong> and a slowdown in China.</li>
<li>The IMF predicts global trade volume (both merchandise and services) to slow to 4.1 per cent and 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2023, down from 10.1 per cent in 2021.</li>
<li>With world growth and trade flows moderating, along with a drop in commodities prices,<strong> India’s export growth is likely to be lower than last year.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>External financial condition</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current account deficit remains a concern.</li>
<li>India’s<strong> external balance sheet</strong> remains quite robust, as is evident from various balance of payments and debt metrics, and reportedly <strong>low unhedged foreign currency borrowings.</strong></li>
<li>Continued <strong>tightening by global central banks</strong>, particularly the US Federal Reserve over the rest of 2022, will keep India’s external financial conditions tight and likely <strong>limit portfolio capital flows. </strong></li>
<li>However, there are some signs emanating from these central banks that the hitherto front-loaded tightening might moderate going forward.</li>
<li>This will <strong>take some pressure off the rupee,</strong> though, exchange rate volatility management will remain a part of the overall monetary policy management framework.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenge of surplus liquidity</h4>
<ul>
<li>During the earlier phase of policy normalisation and the recent tightening, liquidity management has played an important role in influencing short-term money market interest rates.</li>
<li><strong>The current latent surplus liquidity</strong> — the existing funds with banks and the Union government’s unspent revenues parked with RBI — is over Rs 5 lakh crore.</li>
<li>While the extent of liquidity surplus during the Covid months has come down, these levels are still much higher than RBI estimates of non-inflationary levels of surplus, <strong>which is around Rs 1.8-2.4 lakh crore. </strong></li>
<li>This will gradually fall with cash withdrawals and some potential RBI dollar sales in the coming months.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The central bank, in coordination with the government, has ensured an orderly evolution of economic conditions during a very complex and challenging environment. The exit process now will also need the same adroit use of policy instruments.</p>

<hr/>
<h4>Back2Basics: Standing Deposit Facility rate</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in April 2022 introduced the <strong>Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)</strong>, an additional tool for absorbing liquidity, at an interest rate of 3.75 per cent.</li>
<li>The main purpose of SDF is to reduce the excess liquidity  in the system, and control inflation.</li>
<li>In 2018, the amended Section 17 of the RBI Act empowered the Reserve Bank to introduce the SDF –<strong> an additional tool for absorbing liquidity without any collateral. </strong></li>
<li>By removing the binding collateral constraint on the RBI, the SDF strengthens the operating framework of monetary policy.</li>
<li>The SDF is also a financial stability tool in addition to its role in liquidity management.</li>
<li>The SDF replaced the fixed rate reverse repo (FRRR) as the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor.</li>
<li>The SDF rate will be 25 bps below the policy rate (Repo rate), and it will be applicable to overnight deposits at this stage.</li>
<li>It would, however, retain the flexibility to absorb liquidity of longer tenors as and when the need arises, with appropriate pricing.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Trade and settlement of payments in rupee</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>A number of countries, including India, are now considering the use of other currencies to avoid the U.S. dollar and its hegemonic role in settling international transactions.</p>
<h4>Currency hierarchy</h4>
<ul>
<li>For India, currency hierarchy goes back to colonial times when the Indian rupee was virtually <strong>linked to the British pound</strong> rather than to gold which it earned through exports.</li>
<li>In the post-War period, the neo-colonial currency hierarchy has been clubbed with the continued use, primarily of the U.S. dollar, for the majority of international transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rupee settlement of trade</h4>
<ul>
<li>In recent times, India has been taking an active interest in having the rupee used for trade and the settlement of payments with other countries, which include Russia, now facing sanctions.</li>
<li>The Reserve Bank of India has recently taken a proactive stand to have rupee settlement of trade (circular dated July 11, 2022).</li>
<li>While options for invoicing in rupees were already legal in terms of Regulation 7(1) of the <strong>Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016,</strong> the current circular aims to operationalise the special<strong> Vostro accounts with Russian banks in India</strong>, in a bid to promote trade and also gain a better status for the rupee as an international currency.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Opportunities for India</h4>
<ul>
<li>The advantages India is currently seeking in these arrangements include avoidance of transactions in the highly priced dollar which has an exchange value of ₹80, impacting the Indian economy with inflation, capital flight and the <strong>drop in foreign exchange reserves</strong> by $70 billion since September 2021.</li>
<li> Buying oil with a depreciated ruble, and at discounts, is not only cost-saving but also saves transport time with the use of multi-modal routes using land, sea and air routes.</li>
<li>In addition, India is looking forward to trade expansion in sanctions-affected Russia.</li>
<li>With India having a trade deficit with Russia, which has been around $<strong>3.52 billion</strong> on average over the last two financial years, India’s opportunities include the possible use, by Russia, of the surpluses in the Vostro rupee account in Russian banks for additional purchases from India.</li>
<li><strong>Past attempts</strong>: Attempts to use the rupee for invoicing and trading is, however, not new to India.</li>
<li>A comprehensive bilateral trade and payments agreement was signed by India in 1953 with the Soviet bloc countries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are quite a few problems that may prevail in implementing the desired rupee payments and avoiding dollar transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Willingness of banks and private parties:</strong> Apart from issues that concern an agreed<strong> exchange rate</strong> between the rupee and the ruble (R-R), two volatile currencies, there is also the question of the willingness of private parties (companies, banks) to accept the rupee for trade and settlements.</li>
<li> If Russia opens its door for exports from India, the ‘R-R’ route may prove attractive for Indian exporters.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns of the US:</strong> There are official concerns for reactions, particularly from the U.S., to deals, especially for purchase of the S-400 defence equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction of the Europe:</strong> Moreover, the deals between India and Russia, especially on oil, can be considered by the West as ‘indirect back door support’ — as India is importing Russian crude<strong> at 30% discount,</strong> processing at refineries in Gujarat which include Reliance, and then exporting those to the West.</li>
<li><strong>Trade deficit:</strong> There were attempts even before the novel coronavirus pandemic to initiate a clearing account on the BRICS platform.</li>
<li>The quantitative implications indicate a skewed pattern of transactions — with China having most of the trade surplus.</li>
<li>It is a pattern similar to what is happening in India-Russia trade at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The India-Soviet agreements of the past may provide a clue on how the current ‘R-R’ trade and the problems can be managed by initiating a push for Indian exports to Russia and, of course, avoiding all deals in dollars — benefiting both trade partners and countering, globally, the on-going currency hierarchy.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Tax buoyancy</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Paper 3- Tax-to-GDP ratio</p></div></div><h4>Context</h4>
<p>What the data conclusively show is that the debate on the Indian economy should shift away from simplistic notions (borrowed from the West?) of the tax-GDP ratio being low in India.</p>
<h4>India’s low tax-to-GDP ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the stylised beliefs in India, and amongst some leading economic commentators both in India and abroad, is that our tax/GDP ratio is lower than what it “should” be.</li>
<li>This low tax-to-GDP ratio is blamed for a<strong> lower rate of investment</strong>, a<strong> higher fiscal deficit</strong>, and lower GDP growth — and all because the tax ratio is too low.</li>
<li>There can be reasonable doubts about the presumed links.</li>
<li>There are three important fiscal variables in the economy — <strong>taxes, fiscal deficit, and debt. </strong></li>
<li>They are inter-related — lower tax revenue means higher fiscal deficit, for the same level of expenditures, and higher deficit means higher debt.</li>
<li>All three, directly or indirectly, are assumed <strong>to affect growth and/or inflation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Analysing India’s tax-to-GDP ratio</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two common observations on tax-to-GDP for India — first, it is low at around<strong> 10-11 per cent of GDP</strong> and it has stayed at close to that level for the last 20 years.</li>
<li>In 2019, it hit a decade low of 10 per cent of GDP, the same as in 2014.</li>
<li>Second, in comparison with our peers, it is much lower.</li>
<li>Hence, logic dictates that we should strive to increase it.</li>
<li>But which country should we compare India with?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues with comparing tax-to-GDP with other countries</h4>
<ul>
<li>A common observation is to look at the tax-GDP ratio in G20 countries.</li>
<li><strong>Function of average level of per capita income:</strong> This is the beginning of a set of misinterpretations committed either knowingly, or unknowingly.</li>
<li>Because simple logic dictates that tax collected is <strong>a function of the average level of per capita income.</strong></li>
<li>Per capita income in the G20 varies from around $2,100 (India) to around $65,000 (US).</li>
<li>The 10-11 per cent figure for India is the tax/GDP <strong>ratio for taxes administered at the central level.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in data collection</strong>: Taxes in India, as in many other large, especially federal, countries, are collected at both a federal and state level.</li>
<li>And many economies have local (municipal) taxes as well. The tax collected is the sum of all these taxes.</li>
<li>Until now, collecting such disaggregated data for a large set of countries was challenging.</li>
<li>However, in a recent web publication, the IMF on their World Revenue Longitudinal Data set has published such data for all countries, from 1990-2019.</li>
<li>In this pre-pandemic year, among G20 economies, India’s tax-GDP (Xtax) ratio of 16.7 per cent was higher than that of China (15.9 per cent), Mexico (14.1 per cent), Indonesia (11.0 per cent), Saudi Arabia (5.9 per cent) and Turkey (15.9 per cent).</li>
<li>A more informative indicator of whether a country is taxing too much or too little in comparison with others is to look at the <strong>tax-GDP ratio adjusted for PPP per capita income.</strong></li>
<li>Prediction via a simple regression of tax-to-GDP on log PPP per capita GDP can yield one estimate of the tax gap — the difference between actual and actual adjusted for level of income.</li>
<li>The world average tax gap is -1.3 per cent;<strong> India is +1.2 per cent for the nine years 2011-2019.</strong></li>
<li>So, India’s tax GDP ratio averages 2.5 percentage points more than an average economy.</li>
<li>For every year for which data are available 1990-2019, India has had a positive tax gap — there is little evidence that a higher tax/GDP ratio helps growth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How corporate tax cut helped India</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate tax cut 2019:</strong> For years, the advocacy in India was to increase revenue from corporate tax which is one of three major components of tax revenue, the other being income and indirect taxes.</li>
<li>In September 2019, Finance Minister going well against Indian established conventional wisdom, lowered the corporate tax rate by around 10 percentage points.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding triple whammy</strong>: Opponents said that empirical evidence around the world (for example, the US) meant that <strong>if tax rates were lowered, revenues would decline, the fisc would increase, as would inequality.</strong></li>
<li>A triple whammy that is best avoided.</li>
<li>However, now, three years later, we can assess the efficacy (or not) of this bold experiment.</li>
<li>For the three months April-June 2022, corporate tax revenues, y-o-y, are up 30 per cent.</li>
<li>Using fiscal 2019-20 as a base, corporate tax revenue has increased by 66 per cent, GDP by 33 per cent —<strong> an average tax buoyancy of 2.0 over three years. </strong></li>
<li>The previous largest tax buoyancy was in 2006-7 when the world was buoyant.</li>
<li>Tentatively, the tax-GDP ratio in the fiscal year 2022-23 will <strong>average over 18 per cent in India</strong>, a level close to Japan and the US.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>In India, the debate should shift to expenditures, and quality of expenditures (and perhaps to reform of the direct tax code). In this regard, suggestion that freebies be critically examined is most timely and welcome.</p>

<h4> Back2Basics: Tax buoyancy and tax elasticity</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax buoyancy:</strong> The buoyancy of a tax system <b>measures the total response of tax revenue both to changes in</b>. <b>national income and to discretionary changes in tax policies over time</b>, and it is traditionally interpreted as the percentage change in revenue associated to a one percent change in income.</li>
<li>Tax elasticity: It refers to changes in tax revenue in response to <strong>changes in tax rate. </strong></li>
<li>For example, how tax revenue changes if the government reduces corporate income tax from 30 per cent to 25 per cent indicate tax elasticity.</li>

<ul>
<li>India’s old age poverty will be big by 2050. Only 2% informal workers have invested in NPS.</li>
</ul>
<div aria-controls="exacc_WDwQY7CYD8uSseMPtuiLqA0_6" aria-expanded="true" aria-labelledby="exacc_WDwQY7CYD8uSseMPtuiLqA0_5" class="wWOJcd" role="button" tabindex="0">
<h4 aria-hidden="true" class="iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf" id="exacc_WDwQY7CYD8uSseMPtuiLqA0_5"><strong>What is the real definition of poverty?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><strong>Why is age a cause of poverty?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The “oldest-old”, aged 80 years or over, are less able to work than younger older persons; are more likely to have spent their savings; and are most in need of age-appropriate health and long-term personal care services.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How age induces poverty in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India has no legal provisions for income security of the elderly, making the impacts of ageing far harsher for those who are already economically vulnerable.</li>
<li>Deteriorating brain and muscle capacity are largely non-negotiable facts of life, limiting one’s ability to get a job or remain employed.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reasons for old age poverty</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><img alt="old age poverty" class="alignnone wp-image-628689" height="335" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066-768x576.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ph_5067_93066.jpg 1024w" width="447"/></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency:</strong> A large section of the senior population in India is still dependent on the joint family set up for their senior care and post-retirement needs, with financial planning for retirement taking a back seat.</li>
<li><strong>High population</strong>: An increase in the number of seniors in India will reduce the percentage of India’s human resource capital and its ability to drive economic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Low insurance penetration</strong>: This highlights the inadequacy and underscores the critical need to streamline retirement planning schemes and strengthen the pension programs in the country. There is a lacks of social security framework.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Data to remember</strong></p>
<p>People employed in the unorganised sector form around 90 per cent of India’s workforce.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>How to assure wellness and dignity to elders?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Income security in the form of monthly pensions either state-assured or employment-linked has been one of the most prevalent modes of assuring continued wellness and dignity against the life-shock of ageing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="old age poverty" class="alignnone wp-image-628690" height="427" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2-300x212.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2-768x543.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3290ed_a69e41db5fd34b5089032c755f98e89b_mv2.jpg 1000w" width="604"/>Addressing the roadblock</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal pension program:</strong> Income security in later years stems from multiple sources such as pensions, insurances (medical and life), Investments. This provides an opportunity for India to create a universal pension program for its 1.3 billion people<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Financial incentives: </strong>There is a pressing need to promote and facilitate fiscal planning in the early years and supplement it with senior-friendly tax structures and integrated insurance products. Such measures can help provide multiple income options to seniors to help them embrace a lifestyle of their choice.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory mechanism: </strong>A regulatory mechanism will set a viable base rate for the interest accrued on senior citizen deposits and ensure market dips don’t affect retirement income and senior-specific saving plans.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Case study</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rwanda has achieved roughly 2 million voluntary micro-pension enrolments (30 per cent of its adult population) within three years by making digital account activation easy and simple for informal workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/centre-proposes-to-hike-monthly-pensions-for-the-elderly-poor-disabled-and-widows/"><strong>Government intervention to improve elderly wellness </strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A strong and sustained political commitment,</li>
<li>A statutory pension sector regulator,</li>
<li>A well-designed and low-cost NPS product architecture,</li>
<li>Credible and well-regulated NPS intermediaries,</li>
<li>Securities market capable of delivering high returns,</li>
<li>Near-universal banking and mobile penetration,</li>
<li>The India Stack infrastructure with Aadhaar for easy eKYC, and UPI for secure digital payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The government, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and the NPS industry now need to urgently put their heads together and address the obvious supply and demand side barriers. Every day is precious. After all, pension exclusion is akin to climate change. It needs immediate attention. By 2050, India’s problem of old age poverty will have become way too large, too late, too expensive and entirely irreversible<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>Nearly 400 million young, economically active Indians are slowly walking towards extreme old age poverty in this context how will you explain and analyse the term old age poverty? Suggest some dynamic measures to address this problem.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>A team of researchers at the IIT — Guwahati has developed an edible coating using marine alga that coated on vegetables and fruits, substantially extends their shelf-life.</p>
<h4>Dunaliella tertiolecta: The Edible coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>The team used a mix of an extract of a marine microalga called Dunaliella tertiolecta and polysaccharides to produce it.</li>
<li>The microalga is known for its antioxidant properties and has various bioactive compounds such as carotenoids and proteins.</li>
<li>It is also used to produce algal oil, a non-animal source of omega-3 fatty acid and is considered a good source of biofuel.</li>
<li>After the oil is extracted, the residue is usually discarded.</li>
<li>The researchers used extracts from this residue in formulating their film, in combination with chitosan, which is a carbohydrate.</li>
<li>It also has antimicrobial and antifungal properties and can be made into an edible film.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of this Edible coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>The films displayed superior antioxidant activity, thermal stability, mechanical strength, total phenolic content and water vapour barrier property.</li>
<li>They also had excellent UV-Vis light-blocking properties.</li>
<li>The researchers also tested the biosafety of these coatings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is it viable?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The new coatings can be mass-produced.</li>
<li>They are very stable to light, heat, and temperature up to 40C, edible, and can be safely eaten as part of the product formulation and do not add unfavourable properties to it.</li>
<li>They retain texture, colour, appearance, flavour and nutritional value.</li>
<li>The material can be either directly coated on the vegetables and fruits or made into a vegetable storage pouch.</li>
<li>In both cases, the shelf-life of the vegetables can be extended.</li>
<li>It is a simple dip coating technique with no significant cost added to the post-harvest processing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Economic significance of Edible coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/agri-research-role-of-icar/">Indian Council of Agricultural Research</a>, between 4.6 and 15.9 per cent of fruits and vegetables go waste post-harvest, partly due to poor storage conditions.</li>
<li>In fact, post-harvest loss in certain produce items like potato, onion, and tomato could even be as high as 19%, which results in high prices for this highly consumed commodity.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Vizhinjam Port Project</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Port-led development in India</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-628741" height="237" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vizhi-300x237.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vizhi-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/vizhi.jpg 435w" width="300"/></p>
<p>Vizhinjam near Thiruvananthapuram, is on the boil due to the under-construction Vizhinjam Port Project, from both sea and land.</p>
<h4>Vizhinjam Port Project</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Vizhinjam International Transhipment Deep-water Multipurpose Seaport is an ambitious project taken up by Government of Kerala.</li>
<li>It is designed primarily to cater container transhipment besides multi-purpose and break bulk cargo.</li>
<li>The port is being currently developed in landlord model with a Public Private Partnership component on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer (“DBFOT”) basis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why protests are erupted?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The protestors have been opposing the construction work by the Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited.</li>
<li>Adani group is developing the port on DBFOT basis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What lies at the heart of the protest?</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to fisherfolk, the port work has aggravated the coastal erosion along the coast of Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
<li>A scientific study to assess the impact of the port work on the shoreline has to be conducted urgently by stopping the construction.</li>
<li>Further, around 300 families along the coastline were shifted to relief camps after their houses were destroyed due to high-intensity coastal erosion.</li>
<li>The protesters demand a <strong><u>comprehensive rehabilitation package</u></strong>, an <strong><u>assured minimum wage</u></strong> when the sea turns rough due to inclement weather and subsidised kerosene for boats.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why the Vizhinjam project is considered important?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The port is located on the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula, just 10 nautical miles from the major international sea route and east-west shipping axis.</li>
<li>It has a natural water depth of more than 20 m within a nautical mile from the coast.</li>
<li>The Vizhinjam port is likely to play a pivotal role in the maritime development of the country and Kerala.</li>
<li>The commissioning of the port is expected to leverage the growth of 17 minor ports in the State along with creating thousands of employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NDPS Act</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Issues with NDPS Act</p></div></div><p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-500883" height="683" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ndps-195x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ndps-195x300.jpg 195w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ndps.jpg 658w" width="444"/></p>
<p>While granting bail to a man arrested on June 1 for possessing 29 kg of bhang and 400 g of ganja, Karnataka High Court recently observed that nowhere in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act is bhang referred to as a prohibited drink or prohibited drug.</p>
<h4>What is Bhang?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bhang is the edible preparation made from the leaves of the cannabis plant, often incorporated into drinks such as thandai and lassi, along with various foods.</li>
<li>Bhang has been consumed in the Indian subcontinent for centuries, and is frequently consumed during the festivals of Holi and Mahashivratri.</li>
<li>Its widespread use caught the attention of Europeans, with Garcia da Orta, a Portuguese physician who arrived in Goa in the 16th century, noting that, “Bhang is so generally used and by such a number of people that there is no mystery about it”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bhang and the law</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enacted in 1985, the NDPS Act is the main legislation that deals with drugs and their trafficking.</li>
<li>Various provisions of the Act punish production, manufacture, sale, possession, consumption, purchase, transport, and use of banned drugs, except for medical and scientific purposes.</li>
<li>The NDPS Act defines cannabis (hemp) as a narcotic drug based on the parts of the plant that come under its purview. The Act lists these parts as:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Charas: “The separated resin, in whatever form, whether crude or purified, obtained from the cannabis plant and also includes concentrated preparation and resin known as hashish oil or liquid hashish.”</li>
<li>Ganja: “The flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops), by whatever name they be known or designated.”</li>
<li>“Any mixture, with or without any neutral material, of any of the above forms of cannabis or any drink prepared therefrom.”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The Act, in its definition, excludes seeds and leaves “when not accompanied by the tops”.</li>
<li>Bhang, which is made with the leaves of the plant, is not mentioned in the NDPS Act.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cannabis and criminal liability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Section 20 of the NDPS Act lays out the punishment for the production, manufacture, sale, purchase, import and inter-state export of cannabis, as defined in the Act.</li>
<li>The prescribed punishment is based on the amount of drugs seized.</li>
<li>Contravention that involves a small quantity (100 g of charas/hashish or 1 kg of ganja), will result in rigorous imprisonment for a term that may extend to one year and/or a fine which may extend to Rs 10,000.</li>
<li>For a commercial quantity (1 kg charas/ hashish or 20 kg ganja), rigorous imprisonment of not less than 10 years, which may extend to 20 years, including a fine that is not less than Rs 1,00,000 but may extend to Rs 2,00,000.</li>
<li>Where the contravention involves quantity less than commercial, but greater than small quantity, rigorous imprisonment up to 10 years is prescribed, along with a fine which may extend to Rs 1,00,000.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Alcohol laws</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The most ambitious Delhi’s Alcohol Policy 2021-22 which brought in big discounts for consumers was scrapped on July 31 amid allegations of corruption and irregularities in the drafting and implementation of the policy.</p>
<p>After scrapping the new policy, the Delhi government decided to bring back the ‘<strong><u>old excise regime</u></strong>’ that was in force before.</p>
<blockquote><p>Definitely! We shall not nit-pick the old vs. new policy. Let us generally understand how alcohol is regulated in India.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Alcohol laws of India: A backgrounder</h4>
<ul>
<li>The legal drinking age in India and the laws which regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol vary significantly from state to state.</li>
<li>In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar, Gujarat, Nagaland and Mizoram.</li>
<li>There is partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur.</li>
<li>All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but fix a legal drinking age, which ranges at different ages per region.</li>
<li>In some states the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Regulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol is a subject in the <strong><u>State List</u></strong> under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.</li>
<li>Therefore, the <strong><u>laws governing alcohol vary from state to state</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Liquor in India is generally sold at liquor stores, restaurants, hotels, bars, pubs, clubs and discos but not online.</li>
<li>Some states, like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, prohibit private parties from owning liquor stores making the state government the sole retailer of alcohol in those states.</li>
<li>In some states, liquor may be sold at groceries, departmental stores, banquet halls and/or farm houses.</li>
<li>Some tourist areas have special laws allowing the sale of alcohol on beaches and houseboats.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Drunk driving law</h4>
<ul>
<li>The blood alcohol content (BAC) legal limit is 0.03% or 0.03 mg alcohol in 100 ml blood.</li>
<li>On 1 March 2012, the Union Cabinet approved proposed changes to the Motor Vehicle Act.</li>
<li>Higher penalties were introduced, including fines from ₹2,000 to ₹10,000 and imprisonment from 6 months to 4 years.</li>
<li>Different penalties are assessed depending on the blood alcohol content at the time of the offence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dry days</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dry days are specific days when the sale of alcohol is not permitted.</li>
<li>Most of the Indian states observe these days on major national festivals/occasions such as Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti (2 October).</li>
<li>Dry days are also observed during elections in India.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Taxation on Alcohol</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most states levy either Value added Tax (VAT) or Excise duty or both.</li>
<li>Excise duty is a tax levied to discourage the consumption of a product.</li>
<li>It is calculated on a per-unit basis. Meaning, if you buy 1 litre of liquor, you pay a fixed excise duty of Rs 15.</li>
<li>Value-added Tax is charged in the proportion of the product. If a bottle costs Rs 100, and the state levies 10 percent VAT, the price rises to Rs 110.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tax rates in States</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 29 states/UTs in India approach liquor taxation differently.</li>
<li>For instance, Gujarat has banned its citizens from consuming liquor since 1961.</li>
<li>But outsiders with special licenses can still buy.</li>
<li>Puducherry, on the other hand, earns most of its revenue from alcohol trading.</li>
<li>Bihar has prohibited alcohol consumption entirely, meaning the state’s revenue from liquor consumption is nil.</li>
<li>Its neighbour, Uttar Pradesh, earns the most excise duty on liquor.</li>
<li>The state does not levy VAT but a special duty on liquor, collecting funds for particular purposes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Do you know?</strong></h4>
<p>Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu consume as much as 45 percent of the liquor sold in the country.</p>
<p>Nationally, Maharashtra charges the highest rate but draws only a portion of its revenue from its sales.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Why alcohol isn’t banned everywhere?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taxes from alcohol sales roughly form a quarter of state revenues.</li>
<li>If this stream suddenly stops, states have to compulsorily cut some important spending.</li>
<li>Also, moderate alcohol consumption may provide some health benefits.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Despite all the public talk of the importance of conserving our national heritage, the budget of the ASI, the primary institutional guardian of monuments, in 2021-22 has been reduced by more than Rs 200 cr.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How do you define heritage?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Heritage is the full range of our inherited traditions, monuments, objects, and culture. Most important, it is the range of contemporary activities, meanings, and behaviours that we draw from them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Threats to Indian Heritage</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theft:</strong> The incidents of thefts have been observed usually from unprotected monuments, ancient temples. The thefts cases have also been seen in the protected monuments and museums as well. It is due to negligence of security guards in museums, monuments etc.</li>
<li><strong>Smuggling</strong>: illicit traffic and smuggling in antiquities. Illicit traffic is motivated often by profit and sometimes by the demand for luxuries.</li>
<li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Unregulated tourism, tourist activities run by touts, private agents have affected the art heritage places. The Culture Ministry of India has reported that up to 24 Indian monuments have been declared “untraceable” or “missing” by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).</li>
<li><strong>Issues with security of museums</strong>: Most of the museums are poorly guarded due to shortage of manpower leading to theft of artifacts, fire accidents etc.</li>
<li><strong>Duplication</strong>: Fakes paintings and art forms leading to threat to livelihoods of artists.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Maintenance</strong>: The state of the wall paintings in Ajanta caves is continuously getting worse, which can be attributed to humidity as well as to a lack of care.</li>
<li><strong>Encroachment on monuments</strong>: Another miss from the ministry has been encroachments of monuments. Over 278 centrally protected monuments have been encroached upon or have illegal occupants, as per government data.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="heritage " class="alignnone wp-image-628759" height="285" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-10-300x208.webp" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-10-300x208.webp 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-10.webp 630w" width="411"/>Why should we protect our heritage?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evolution of human consciousness is a continuous process</strong>: History here serves as a laboratory and the past serves as a demarcation to understand the regional laws and social structures. This understanding helps in our progress towards an ideal society.</li>
<li><strong>Pride of country</strong>: The art heritage is the identity and pride of our country. It is duty of every citizen to protect, preserve and perpetuate the cultural richness.</li>
<li><strong>Tourism potential</strong>: for art monuments and museums is very high. Tourism generates revenue for the state as well as private artists due to the money-multiplier quality.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure development:</strong> takes place in and around the areas. Eg. Hampi despite being a small town has excellent infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs:</strong> It creates jobs for a lot of people from art industry and tourism industry as well</li>
<li><strong>Sense of belonging</strong>: It creates a feeling of oneness and a sense of attachment by enhancing a sense of belonging to a culture or a region.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen conviction</strong>: Every historical site has an important story to tell and these stories have inspired many people to strengthen their convictions and commitment to fight injustice and oppression.</li>
<li><strong>Soft power</strong>: Art and culture is also a part of soft power in world politics.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>About Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ASI is an attached office of the Ministry of Culture.</li>
<li>It was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its first Director-General.</li>
<li>Under the provisions of the AMASR Act of 1958, the ASI administers more than 3650 ancient monuments, archaeological sites and remains of national importance.</li>
<li>These can include everything from temples, mosques, churches, tombs, and cemeteries to palaces, forts, step-wells, and rock-cut caves.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Initiatives by ASI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Museums: </strong>ASI’s museums are customarily located right next to the sites that their inventories are associated with “so that they may be studied amid their natural surroundings and not lose focus by being transported”. A dedicated Museums Branch maintains a total of 44 museums spread across the country.</li>
<li><strong>Publications by ASI: </strong>Epigraphia Indica, Ancient India, Indian Archaeology: A Review (Annually).</li>
<li><strong>Library</strong>: <strong>Central Archaeological Library </strong>in the <strong>National Archives building</strong> in Janpath, New Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Issues and Challenges ahead of ASI </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>To restore or not: </strong>Issue is that technically speaking- ruins are seldom “restored” in original state. This is because in absence of documentation- archaeologists are left to conjecture what buildings may have looked like when they were originally built.</li>
<li><strong>Personnel Management Issues: </strong>Higher Authorities of ASI are traditionally from IAS Cadre<strong>. </strong>In-house specialist must be promoted for better coordination b/w technical and managerial aspects of restoration</li>
<li><strong>Issues explored in CAG Report: </strong>92 monuments are untraceable with no database on artifacts<strong>. </strong>Poor Documentation of Protected Monuments/Artifacts<strong>. </strong>Paucity of funds (Eg- Red fort gardens lie unkempt).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is the duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture. Preservation and conservation of India’s rich cultural heritage and promotion of all forms of art and culture, both tangible and intangible, is essential and assumes a lot of importance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong><strong> Safeguarding the Indian heritage is the need of the moment.</strong> <strong>What are the challenges faced in safeguarding them? What steps would you suggest to protect them?</strong></p>

<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The country’s move is a departure from the norm and is been seen as an attempt to appease China.</li>
<li>This raises concerns about China’s growing influence in the country and the region at large.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where is the Solomon Islands located?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania, to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu.</li>
<li>Its capital, Honiara, is located on the largest island, Guadalcanal.</li>
<li>It is part of the ethnically Melanesian group of islands in the Pacific and lies between Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.</li>
<li>The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (a part of Papua New Guinea).</li>
<li>It excludes outlying islands, such as the Santa Cruz Islands and Rennell and Bellona.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quick recap of its past</h4>
<ul>
<li>The islands, which were initially controlled by the British Empire during the colonial era, went through the hands of Germany and Japan.</li>
<li>It then went back to the UK after the Americans took over the islands from the Japanese during World War II.</li>
<li>The islands became independent in 1978 to become a constitutional monarchy under the British Crown, with a parliamentary system of government.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, its inability to manage domestic ethnic conflicts led to close security relations with Australia, which is the traditional first responder to any crisis in the South Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How did China enter the picture?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Earlier this year, the Solomon Islands established a <strong><u>security agreement with China</u></strong>, saying it needed Beijing’s assistance with its domestic security situation.</li>
<li>But the <strong><u>announcement had rattled the west</u></strong>, esp. the US, Australia and others in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
<li>The concerns were that the agreement could potentially lead to a <strong><u>Chinese military base on the island nation</u></strong> and a gain in power-projection capabilities.</li>
<li>At that time, following intense scrutiny, the Solomon Islands had <strong><u>denied</u></strong> that the agreement would allow China to establish a naval base.</li>
<li>The Island insisted that the agreement was only to <strong><u>assist the Solomon Islands with what he called “hard internal threats”.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the Solomon Islands’ stance?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The government has asked all partner countries with plans to conduct naval visits or patrols to put them on hold until a <strong><u>revised national mechanism</u></strong> is in place.</li>
<li>The revised national mechanism <strong><u>applied to all foreign vessels seeking access to the country’s ports</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The nation wanted to <strong><u>build up its</u></strong> <strong><u>own naval capacity</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It has some <strong><u>unfortunate experiences of foreign naval vessels entering its waters</u></strong> without any diplomatic clearance.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is behind China’s growing influence in the region?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is no dispute that China has been rapidly increasing its presence and influence in the region for over three decades, particularly in the South Pacific.</li>
<li>Certainly Beijing views the Pacific Island region as an <strong><u>important component of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). </u></strong></li>
<li>Specifically, it sees the region as a critical air freight hub in its so-called <strong><u>Air Silk Road</u></strong>, which connects Asia with Central and South America.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Concerns of the West</h4>
<ul>
<li>The United States and its regional allies, such as Australia and New Zealand, are concerned that the China-Solomon Islands security pact allows Chinese naval vessels to replenish there.</li>
<li>That could open the <strong><u>door to a Chinese naval base</u></strong>, which would significantly extend China’s military reach in the South Pacific.”</li>
<li>It is likely that this security agreement between China and the Solomon Islands has been driven by, what the CFR calls, Beijing’s “<strong><u>sense of vulnerability</u></strong>” in the region.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the rationale for the Solomon Islands’ increasing proximity to China?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Solomon Islands had cultivated strong ties with Taiwan, which ended with the emergence of the current government in Honiara.</li>
<li>In 2019, the regime change switched Taiwan for China.</li>
<li>This was supposedly after Beijing offered half a billion US dollars in financial aid, roughly five times what Taiwan spent on the islands in the past two decades.</li>
<li>It has been alleged by the pro-Taiwan Opposition that the incumbent government has been bribed by China.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is China interested in the Solomon Islands?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolating Taiwan:</strong> The Solomon Islands was one among the six Pacific island states which had official bilateral relations with Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>Supporter in UN:</strong> The small Pacific island states act as potential vote banks for mobilising support for the great powers in international fora like the United Nations.</li>
<li><strong>Larger EEZ:</strong> These states have disproportionately large maritime Exclusive Economic Zones when compared to their small sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Natural resources:</strong> Solomon Islands, in particular, have significant reserves of timber and mineral resources, along with fisheries.</li>
<li><strong>Countering US:</strong> But more importantly, they are strategically located for China to insert itself between America’s military bases in the Pacific islands and Australia.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What does this mean for the established geopolitical configuration in the region?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diminishing western influence:</strong> The Pacific islands, in the post-World War II scenario, were exclusively under the spheres of influence of the Western powers, in particular, the US, UK, France and Australia and New Zealand.</li>
<li><strong>Inserting into western hegemony:</strong> All of them have territorial possessions in the region, with the three nuclear powers among them having used the region as a nuclear weapons testing ground.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting of dependencies:</strong> The smaller island nations of the region are heavily dependent on them, especially Australia as it is a resident power.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Damage control by West</h4>
<ul>
<li>Australia has reacted with boosted finances, and by extending its current security mission till 2023 when the islands will host the Pacific Games.</li>
<li>The US has responded by considering reopening its embassy in Honiara after a long 29-year gap.</li>
<li>New Zealand has shed its typical restraint about China and has criticised it for attempting to militarise the Pacific islands.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>particulars of the bill</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>electricity reforms</p></div></div><h4><strong><img alt="electricity" class="alignnone wp-image-629013" height="343" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/download.jpeg" width="558"/>Context </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Concerns of states on some provisions of the new Electricity Bill are justified. But the legislation proposes welcome correctives to longstanding problems of the power sector.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Important provisions of the bill</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payment security</strong>: The Bill provides that electricity will not be scheduled or despatched if adequate payment security is not provided by the discom.   The central government may prescribe rules regarding payment security.</li>
<li><strong>Contract enforcement</strong>: The Bill empowers the CERC and SERCs to adjudicate disputes related to the performance of contracts.  These refer to contracts related to the sale, purchase, or transmission of electricity.  Further, the Commissions will have powers of a Civil Court.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable purchase obligation</strong>: The Act empowers SERCs to specify renewable purchase obligations (RPO) for discoms.  RPO refers to the mandate to procure a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources.  The Bill adds that RPO should not be below a minimum percentage prescribed by the central government.  Failure to meet RPO will be punishable with a penalty between 25 paise and 50 paise per kilowatt of the shortfall.</li>
<li><strong>Selection committee for SERCs</strong>: Under the Act, the Chairperson of the Central Electricity Authority or the Chairperson of the CERC is one of the members of the selection committee to recommend appointments to the SERCs.  Under the Bill, instead of this person, the central government will nominate a member to the selection committee.  The nominee should not be below the rank of Additional Secretary to the central government.</li>
<li><strong>Composition of Commissions and APTEL</strong>: The Bill increases the number of members (including the chairperson) in SERCs from three to four.  Further, at least one member in both the CERC and SERCs must be from law background.  Under the Act, Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) consists of a chairperson and three other members.  The Bill instead provides that the APTEL will have three or more members, as may be prescribed by the central government.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>State apprehensions of the bill </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi state license: </strong>The clause pertaining to applicants seeking a distribution licence in more than one state. It states that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), and not the SERC, will grant the licence. This is problematic because a SERC is likely to be more aware of the field-level conditions in a state than its central counterpart.</li>
<li><strong>Centre can bypass state: </strong>The Bill has a provision empowering the Centre to give directions directly to the SERCs. Till now, the CERC received instructions from the Centre and the SERCs were under the state. The new Bill enables the Centre to bypass state governments. It’s not surprising that this is a matter of concern for the states.</li>
<li><strong>Direct appointment by centre:</strong> The Bill states that the SERC chairperson will now be a nominee of the central government and will be an additional secretary-level official. This gives the impression that the Centre is trying to control the appointments to the SERCs<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/power-sector-reforms/"><strong>Why the bill is important? </strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compensation clause: </strong>The Bill states that if power purchase agreement PPAs are renegotiated, the affected party has to be compensated within 90 days from the date of submission of the petition.</li>
<li><strong>Uniformity in tariffs revision:</strong> New tariffs have to be made applicable from the beginning of the financial year. New tariffs often come into force in the middle of the financial year (due to delays in the issuing of orders by SERCs). This means that discoms do not earn their full revenues leading to cash flow problems.</li>
<li><strong>Easy tariff petition processing now:</strong> The Bill has proposed a reduction in the time for processing tariff petitions from 120 days to 90 days.</li>
<li><strong>Suo moto jurisdiction</strong>: Regulatory commissions have been given suo motu jurisdiction if tariff petitions are not filed within 30 days of the stipulated time. This too is a step in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>More teeth to load dispatcher: </strong>the Bill proposes to give more teeth to the national load dispatcher. We need to strengthen the load dispatcher for the smooth functioning of the grid, especially with a huge renewable capacity where intermittency of generation is a major issue in the offing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The rollout of the proposed amendments through a consensus-based approach would go a long way in overhauling the weakest link in the nation’s power supply chain.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In the recent few years, the growth of the economy and urbanization have accelerated. Rapid unplanned urbanization has put extreme pressure on natural resources.</li>
<li>Unplanned urbanization, however, exerts great strain on our cities. In fact, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the dire need for the planning and management of our cities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does urban planning mean?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Urban planning, also known as regional planning, town planning, city planning is a technical and political process that is focused on the development and design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks and their accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are ‘Happy Cities’?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A term that follows the Green City, Sustainable City, Liveable City, in the lingo of urban planning</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is a smart city?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A smart city is one that uses information and communication technologies to enhance citizen engagement. It is a neo-vision which seeks to improve the delivery of services in urban areas. The following story maps out the steps being taken by India to explore this concept in practice.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the Smart Cities Mission?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable cities</strong>: The Smart Cities Mission aims at developing 100 cities, which were shortlisted, into self-sustainable urban settlements.</li>
<li><strong>Chronology</strong>: The mission was launched on June 25, 2015 and was projected as one aimed at transforming the process of urban development in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive revamp</strong>: Among its strategic components is ‘area-based development’, which includes city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (Greenfield development), plus a pan-city initiative in which ‘smart solutions’ are applied covering larger parts of the city.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fast Facts – Urbanization in India</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most Urbanized States: Tamil Nadu 43.9%; Maharashtra 4%; Gujarat  37.4%</li>
<li>3 out of world’s 21 mega cities: Mumbai (19 mill); Delhi (15 mill); Kolkata (14 mill)</li>

<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many urban governments lack a modern planning framework</li>
<li>The multiplicity of local bodies obstructs efficient planning and land use</li>
<li>Rigid master plans and restrictive zoning regulations limit the land available for building, constricting cities’ abilities to grow in accordance with changing needs<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Housing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building regulations that limit urban density – such as floor space indexes – reduce the number of houses available, thereby pushing up property prices</li>
<li>Outdated rent control regulations reduce the number of houses available on rent – a critical option for the poor</li>
<li>Policy, planning, and regulation deficiencies lead to a proliferation of slums</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Service delivery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a strong bias towards adding physical infrastructure rather than providing financially and environmentally sustainable services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most urban bodies do not generate the revenues needed to renew infrastructure, nor do they have the creditworthiness to access capital markets for funds</li>
<li>Urban transport planning needs to be more holistic – there is a focus on moving vehicles rather than meeting the needs of the large numbers of people who walk or ride bicycles in India’s towns and cities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The deteriorating urban environment is taking a toll on people’s health and productivity and diminishing their quality of life.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Demystifying Planning and Involving Citizens: </strong>While it is important to maintain the master plans’ technical rigour, it is equally important to demystify them for enabling citizens’ participation at relevant stages. Therefore, the committee strongly recommends a ‘Citizen Outreach Campaign’ for demystifying urban planning.</li>
<li><strong>Steps for Enhancing the Role of Private Sector: </strong>The report recommends that concerted measures must be taken at multiple levels to strengthen the role of the private sector to improve the overall planning capacity in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Revision of Town and Country Planning Acts: </strong>Most States have enacted the Town and Country Planning acts, that enable them to prepare and notify master plans for implementation. However, many need to be reviewed and upgraded.</li>

<ul>
<li>According to available UNESCO data on some selected countries, India is at the lowest position, having only 14% female researchers working in STEM areas highlighting the presence of glass ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is glass ceiling? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A glass ceiling is a metaphor used to represent an invisible barrier that prevents women from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. The metaphor was first coined by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What Is a Gender-equal Society?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A society in which both women and men shall be given equal opportunities to participate voluntarily in activities in all fields as equal partners, and be able to enjoy political, economic, social and cultural benefits equally as well as to share responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How glass ceiling limits women progress?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Few opportunities</strong>: Due to deep-rooted biases, it is difficult for women to access many experiences and networks that are easily accessible to men.</li>
<li><strong>Social barriers and gender norms</strong>: Personal barriers include notions of compromise and sacrifice that are ingrained in women. This feeds into how women present themselves. External barriers and cultural cues reinforce how men and women “ought” to behave.</li>
<li><strong>Gender Inequity</strong>: Stereotypes related to gender brilliance or gender-based intrinsic aptitude generate inequity which remains unnoticed.</li>
<li><strong>Low self-confidence</strong>: Our socio-cultural constructs reflect absolute patriarchy causing even women to be sceptical about their abilities, to accept the roles set for them in the household.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Around the world, finding a job is much tougher for women than it is for men. When women are employed, they tend to work in low-quality jobs in vulnerable conditions, and there is little improvement forecast in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="glass ceiling" class="alignnone wp-image-629355" height="261" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ilustration-two-persons-at-different-high-300x203.jpeg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ilustration-two-persons-at-different-high-300x203.jpeg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ilustration-two-persons-at-different-high.jpeg 696w" width="386"/><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/explained-why-are-there-more-men-than-women-in-the-field-of-stem/">What are STEM areas?</a></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and refers to any subjects that fall under these four disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are the drivers at policy and programme level to promote women in STEM in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Breaking myths and stereotypes around STEM is crucial to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 (gender equality) which includes women’s use of enabling technology, including ICT as a means of achieving economic empowerment and greater agency and also many other STEM-related SDGs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="glass ceiling" class="alignnone wp-image-629353" height="267" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B-300x176.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B-300x176.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B-768x450.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KIRAN-Women-Scientist-Scheme-B.jpg 1000w" width="456"/>Government initiatives </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>GATI: </strong>It will be called GATI (Gender Advancement through Transforming Institutions). The DST is incorporating a system of grading institutes depending on the enrolment of women and the advancement of the careers of women faculty and scientists.</li>
<li><strong>CURIE</strong>: For infrastructure in women’s universities</li>
<li><strong>Vigyan Jyoti Scheme</strong>: Encourage girls in high school to pursue STEM</li>
<li><strong>The Athena Swan Charter: </strong>is a framework which is used across the globe to support and transform gender equality within higher education (HE) and research.</li>
<li><strong>KIRAN</strong>: (Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through nurturing) Scheme to encourage women Scientists</li>
<li><strong>Indo-US Fellowship:</strong> for Women in STEMM (STEM and Medicine)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Gender equality or parity will happen only when there is a change in mind-set and institutions consider women as assets rather than simply a diversity rectification issue. Policies that help women advance in science and society globally are needed. The world cannot afford to miss out on what women have to offer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you understand by the term glass ceiling? Discuss how it has hampered the women participation in high end research STEM jobs by citing some government initiatives to address this.</strong></p></blockquote>
