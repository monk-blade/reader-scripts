<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Solar energy targets of India</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>From less than 10 MW in 2010, India has added significant PV capacity over the past decade, achieving over 50 GW by 2022.</p>
<h4>Solar energy in India</h4>
<ul>
<li>Solar photovoltaics (PV) has driven India’s push towards the adoption of cleaner energy generation technologies.</li>
<li><strong><u>India is targeting about 500 GW by 2030</u></strong>, of renewable energy deployment, out of which ~280 GW is expected from solar PV.</li>
<li>This necessitates the deployment of nearly 30 GW of solar capacity every year until 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key components</h4>
<ul>
<li>A typical solar PV value chain consists of first fabricating polysilicon ingots which need to be transformed into thin Silicon wafers that are needed to manufacture the PV mini-modules.</li>
<li>The mini-modules are then assembled into market-ready and field-deployable modules.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Various challenges</h4>
<p>There are challenges that need to be overcome for the sustainability of the PV economy.</p>
<p><strong>(1) PV Modules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indian solar deployment or installation companies <strong><u>depend heavily on imports</u></strong>.</li>
<li>It currently <strong><u>imports 100% of silicon wafers and around 80% of cells</u></strong> even at the current deployment levels.</li>
<li>India currently <strong><u>does not have enough module</u></strong> and cell manufacturing capacity.</li>
<li>India’s current solar module <strong><u>manufacturing capacity is limited to ~15 GW per year</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>demand-supply gap widens</u></strong> as we move up the value chain — for example, India only produces ~3.5 GW of cells currently.</li>
<li>India has <strong><u>no manufacturing capacity</u></strong> for solar wafers and polysilicon ingots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Field deployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Also, out of the 15 GW of module manufacturing capacity, <strong><u>only 3-4 GW of modules</u></strong> are <strong><u>technologically competitive and worthy of deployment</u></strong> in grid-based projects.</li>
<li>India remains dependent on the import of solar modules for field deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Size and technology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the Indian industry is currently tuned to handling M2 wafer size, which is roughly 156 x 156 mm2, while the global industry is already moving towards M10 and M12 sizes, which are 182 x 182 mm2 and 210 x 210 mm2 respectively.</li>
<li>The bigger size has an advantage in terms of silicon cost per wafer, as this effectively means lower loss of silicon during ingot to wafer processing.</li>
<li>In terms of cell technology, most of the manufacturing still uses Al-BSF technology, which can typically give efficiencies of ~18-19% at the cell level and ~16-17% at the module level.</li>
<li>By contrast, cell manufacturing worldwide has moved to PERC (22-23%), HJT(~24%), TOPCON (23-24%) and other newer technologies, yielding module efficiency of &gt;21%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Land issue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Producing more solar power for the same module size means more solar power from the same land area.</li>
<li>Land, the most expensive part of solar projects, is scarce in India — and Indian industry has no choice but to move towards newer and superior technologies as part of expansion plans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5) Raw materials supply</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a <strong><u>huge gap on the raw material supply</u></strong> chain side as well.</li>
<li>Silicon wafer, the most expensive raw material, is not manufactured in India.</li>
<li>India will have to work on technology tie-ups to make the right grade of silicon for solar cell manufacturing — and since &gt;90% of the world’s solar wafer manufacturing currently happens in China.</li>
<li>It is not clear how and where India will get the technology.</li>
<li>Other key raw materials such as <strong><u>metallic pastes of silver and aluminium</u></strong> to form the electrical contacts too, <strong><u>are almost 100% imported</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Thus, <strong><u>India is more of an assembly hub than a manufacturing</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(6) Lack of investment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has hardly invested in this sector which can help the industry to try and test the technologies in a cost-effective manner.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Current govt policy</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><u>government has identified this gap</u></strong>, and is rolling out various policy initiatives to push and motivate the industry to <strong><u>work towards self-reliance</u></strong> in solar manufacturing, both for cells and modules.</li>
<li>Key initiatives include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>40% duty on the import of modules and</li>
<li>25% duty on the import of cells, and</li>
<li>Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to support manufacturing capex</li>
<li>Compulsion to procure modules only from an approved list of manufacturers (ALMM) for projects that are connected to state/ central government grids</li>
<li>Only India-based manufacturers have been approved</li>
</ol>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>India’s path to become a manufacturing hub for the same <strong><u>requires more than just putting some tax barriers and commercial incentives</u></strong> in the form of PLI schemes, etc.</li>
<li>It will warrant <strong><u>strong industry-academia collaboration</u></strong> in an innovative manner to start developing home-grown technologies which could, in the short-term.</li>
<li>It needs to <strong><u>work with the industry</u></strong> to provide them with trained human resource, process learnings, root-cause analysis through right testing and, in the long term, develop India’s own technologies.</li>
<li>High-end technology development requires <strong><u>substantial investment</u></strong> in several clusters which operate in industry-like working and management conditions, appropriate emoluments, and clear deliverables.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Alcohol laws</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Read the attached story</p></div></div><p>The most ambitious Delhi’s Alcohol Policy 2021-22 which brought in big discounts for consumers was scrapped on July 31 amid allegations of corruption and irregularities in the drafting and implementation of the policy.</p>
<p>After scrapping the new policy, the Delhi government decided to bring back the ‘<strong><u>old excise regime</u></strong>’ that was in force before.</p>
<blockquote><p>Definitely! We shall not nit-pick the old vs. new policy. Let us generally understand how alcohol is regulated in India.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Alcohol laws of India: A backgrounder</h4>
<ul>
<li>The legal drinking age in India and the laws which regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol vary significantly from state to state.</li>
<li>In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar, Gujarat, Nagaland and Mizoram.</li>
<li>There is partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur.</li>
<li>All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but fix a legal drinking age, which ranges at different ages per region.</li>
<li>In some states the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Regulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol is a subject in the <strong><u>State List</u></strong> under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.</li>
<li>Therefore, the <strong><u>laws governing alcohol vary from state to state</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Liquor in India is generally sold at liquor stores, restaurants, hotels, bars, pubs, clubs and discos but not online.</li>
<li>Some states, like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, prohibit private parties from owning liquor stores making the state government the sole retailer of alcohol in those states.</li>
<li>In some states, liquor may be sold at groceries, departmental stores, banquet halls and/or farm houses.</li>
<li>Some tourist areas have special laws allowing the sale of alcohol on beaches and houseboats.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Drunk driving law</h4>
<ul>
<li>The blood alcohol content (BAC) legal limit is 0.03% or 0.03 mg alcohol in 100 ml blood.</li>
<li>On 1 March 2012, the Union Cabinet approved proposed changes to the Motor Vehicle Act.</li>
<li>Higher penalties were introduced, including fines from ₹2,000 to ₹10,000 and imprisonment from 6 months to 4 years.</li>
<li>Different penalties are assessed depending on the blood alcohol content at the time of the offence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dry days</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dry days are specific days when the sale of alcohol is not permitted.</li>
<li>Most of the Indian states observe these days on major national festivals/occasions such as Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti (2 October).</li>
<li>Dry days are also observed during elections in India.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Taxation on Alcohol</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most states levy either Value added Tax (VAT) or Excise duty or both.</li>
<li>Excise duty is a tax levied to discourage the consumption of a product.</li>
<li>It is calculated on a per-unit basis. Meaning, if you buy 1 litre of liquor, you pay a fixed excise duty of Rs 15.</li>
<li>Value-added Tax is charged in the proportion of the product. If a bottle costs Rs 100, and the state levies 10 percent VAT, the price rises to Rs 110.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tax rates in States</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 29 states/UTs in India approach liquor taxation differently.</li>
<li>For instance, Gujarat has banned its citizens from consuming liquor since 1961.</li>
<li>But outsiders with special licenses can still buy.</li>
<li>Puducherry, on the other hand, earns most of its revenue from alcohol trading.</li>
<li>Bihar has prohibited alcohol consumption entirely, meaning the state’s revenue from liquor consumption is nil.</li>
<li>Its neighbour, Uttar Pradesh, earns the most excise duty on liquor.</li>
<li>The state does not levy VAT but a special duty on liquor, collecting funds for particular purposes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Do you know?</strong></h4>
<p>Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu consume as much as 45 percent of the liquor sold in the country.</p>
<p>Nationally, Maharashtra charges the highest rate but draws only a portion of its revenue from its sales.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Why alcohol isn’t banned everywhere?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Taxes from alcohol sales roughly form a quarter of state revenues.</li>
<li>If this stream suddenly stops, states have to compulsorily cut some important spending.</li>
<li>Also, moderate alcohol consumption may provide some health benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Eurozone is almost certainly entering a recession, with surveys showing a deepening cost-of-living crisis and a gloomy outlook that is keeping consumers wary of spending.</p>
<h4>What is Recession?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/imf-flags-recession-risk/">recession</a> is a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for months or even years.</li>
<li>Experts declare a recession when a nation’s economy experiences negative GDP, rising levels of unemployment, falling retail sales, and contracting measures of income and manufacturing for an extended period of time.</li>
<li>Recessions are considered an unavoidable part of the business cycle—or the regular cadence of expansion and contraction that occurs in a nation’s economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What causes Recessions?</h4>
<p>These phenomena are some of the main drivers of a recession:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden economic shock:</strong> An economic shock is a surprise problem that creates serious financial damage. The coronavirus outbreak, which shut down economies worldwide, is a more recent example of a sudden economic shock.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive debt:</strong> When individuals or businesses take on too much debt, the cost of servicing the debt can grow to the point where they can’t pay their bills. Growing debt defaults and bankruptcies then capsize the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Asset bubbles:</strong> When investing decisions are driven by emotion, bad economic outcomes aren’t far behind. Investors can become too optimistic during a strong economy.</li>
<li><strong>Too much inflation:</strong> Inflation is the steady, upward trend in prices over time. Inflation isn’t a bad thing per se, but excessive inflation is a dangerous phenomenon. Central banks control inflation by raising interest rates, and higher interest rates depress economic activity.</li>
<li><strong>Too much deflation:</strong> While runaway inflation can create a recession, deflation can be even worse. Deflation is when prices decline over time, which causes wages to contract, which further depresses prices. When a deflationary feedback loop gets out of hand, people and business stop spending, which undermines the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Technological change:</strong> New inventions increase productivity and help the economy over the long term, but there can be short-term periods of adjustment to technological breakthroughs. In the 19th century, there were waves of labour-saving technological improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What’s the difference between <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/imf-flags-recession-risk/">Recession</a> and Depression?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recessions and depressions have similar causes, but the overall impact of a depression is much, much worse.</li>
<li>There are greater job losses, higher unemployment and steeper declines in GDP.</li>
<li>Most of all, a depression lasts longer—years, not months—and it takes more time for the economy to recover.</li>
<li>Economists do not have a set definition or fixed measurements to show what counts as a depression. Suffice to say, all the impacts of a depression are deeper and last longer.</li>
<li>In the past century, the US has faced just one depression: The Great Depression.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Great Depression</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Great Depression started in 1929 and lasted through 1933, although the economy didn’t really recover until World War II, nearly a decade later.</li>
<li>During the Great Depression, unemployment rose to 25% and the GDP fell by 30%.</li>
<li>It was the most unprecedented economic collapse in modern US history.</li>
<li>By way of comparison, the Great Recession was the worst recession since the Great Depression.</li>
<li>During the Great Recession, unemployment peaked around 10% and the recession officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, about a year and a half.</li>
<li>Some economists fear that the coronavirus recession could morph into a depression, depending how long it lasts.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How long do recessions last?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gulf War Recession (July 1990 to March 1991):</strong> At the start of the 1990s, the U.S. went through a short, eight-month recession, partly caused by spiking oil prices during the First Gulf War.</li>
<li><strong>The Great Recession (2008-2009):</strong> As mentioned, the Great Recession was caused in part by a bubble in the real estate market.</li>
<li><strong>Covid-19 Recession:</strong> The most recent recession began in February 2020 and lasted only two months, making it the shortest US recession in history.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can we predict a recession?</h4>
<p>Given that economic forecasting is uncertain, predicting future recessions is far from easy. However, the following warning signs can give you more time to figure out how to prepare for a recession before it happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An inverted yield curve:</strong> The yield curve is a graph that plots the market value—or the yield—of a range. When long-term yields are lower than short-term yields, it shows that investors are worried about a recession. This phenomenon is known as a yield curve inversion, and it has predicted past recessions.</li>
<li><strong>Declines in consumer confidence:</strong> Consumer spending is the main driver of the US economy. If surveys show a sustained drop in consumer confidence, it could be a sign of impending trouble for the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Drop in the Leading Economic Index (LEI):</strong> Published monthly by the Conference Board, the LEI strives to predict future economic trends. It looks at factors like applications for unemployment insurance, new orders for manufacturing and stock market performance.</li>
<li><strong>Sudden stock market declines:</strong> A large, sudden decline in stock markets could be a sign of a recession coming on, since investors sell off parts and sometimes all of their holdings in anticipation of an economic slowdown.</li>
<li><strong>Rising unemployment:</strong> It goes without saying that if people are losing their jobs, it’s a bad sign for the economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does a recession affect individuals?</h4>
<ul>
<li>We may lose your job during a recession, as unemployment levels rise. It becomes much harder to find a job replacement since more people are out of work.</li>
<li>People who keep their jobs may see cuts to pay and benefits, and struggle to negotiate future pay raises.</li>
<li>Investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets can lose money in a recession, reducing your savings and upsetting your plans for retirement.</li>
<li>Business owners make fewer sales during a recession, and may even be forced into bankruptcy.</li>
<li>With more people unable to pay their bills during a recession, lenders tighten standards for mortgages, car loans, and other types of financing.</li>
</ul>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>particulars of the bill</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>electricity reforms</p></div></div><h4><strong><img alt="electricity" class="alignnone wp-image-629013" height="343" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/download.jpeg" width="558"/>Context </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Concerns of states on some provisions of the new Electricity Bill are justified. But the legislation proposes welcome correctives to longstanding problems of the power sector.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Important provisions of the bill</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payment security</strong>: The Bill provides that electricity will not be scheduled or despatched if adequate payment security is not provided by the discom.   The central government may prescribe rules regarding payment security.</li>
<li><strong>Contract enforcement</strong>: The Bill empowers the CERC and SERCs to adjudicate disputes related to the performance of contracts.  These refer to contracts related to the sale, purchase, or transmission of electricity.  Further, the Commissions will have powers of a Civil Court.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable purchase obligation</strong>: The Act empowers SERCs to specify renewable purchase obligations (RPO) for discoms.  RPO refers to the mandate to procure a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources.  The Bill adds that RPO should not be below a minimum percentage prescribed by the central government.  Failure to meet RPO will be punishable with a penalty between 25 paise and 50 paise per kilowatt of the shortfall.</li>
<li><strong>Selection committee for SERCs</strong>: Under the Act, the Chairperson of the Central Electricity Authority or the Chairperson of the CERC is one of the members of the selection committee to recommend appointments to the SERCs.  Under the Bill, instead of this person, the central government will nominate a member to the selection committee.  The nominee should not be below the rank of Additional Secretary to the central government.</li>
<li><strong>Composition of Commissions and APTEL</strong>: The Bill increases the number of members (including the chairperson) in SERCs from three to four.  Further, at least one member in both the CERC and SERCs must be from law background.  Under the Act, Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) consists of a chairperson and three other members.  The Bill instead provides that the APTEL will have three or more members, as may be prescribed by the central government.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>State apprehensions of the bill </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi state license: </strong>The clause pertaining to applicants seeking a distribution licence in more than one state. It states that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), and not the SERC, will grant the licence. This is problematic because a SERC is likely to be more aware of the field-level conditions in a state than its central counterpart.</li>
<li><strong>Centre can bypass state: </strong>The Bill has a provision empowering the Centre to give directions directly to the SERCs. Till now, the CERC received instructions from the Centre and the SERCs were under the state. The new Bill enables the Centre to bypass state governments. It’s not surprising that this is a matter of concern for the states.</li>
<li><strong>Direct appointment by centre:</strong> The Bill states that the SERC chairperson will now be a nominee of the central government and will be an additional secretary-level official. This gives the impression that the Centre is trying to control the appointments to the SERCs<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p><img alt="electricity" class="alignnone wp-image-629016" height="334" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/power-dis-energy-300x208.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/power-dis-energy-300x208.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/power-dis-energy.jpg 650w" width="481"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/power-sector-reforms/"><strong>Why the bill is important? </strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compensation clause: </strong>The Bill states that if power purchase agreement PPAs are renegotiated, the affected party has to be compensated within 90 days from the date of submission of the petition.</li>
<li><strong>Uniformity in tariffs revision:</strong> New tariffs have to be made applicable from the beginning of the financial year. New tariffs often come into force in the middle of the financial year (due to delays in the issuing of orders by SERCs). This means that discoms do not earn their full revenues leading to cash flow problems.</li>
<li><strong>Easy tariff petition processing now:</strong> The Bill has proposed a reduction in the time for processing tariff petitions from 120 days to 90 days.</li>
<li><strong>Suo moto jurisdiction</strong>: Regulatory commissions have been given suo motu jurisdiction if tariff petitions are not filed within 30 days of the stipulated time. This too is a step in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>More teeth to load dispatcher: </strong>the Bill proposes to give more teeth to the national load dispatcher. We need to strengthen the load dispatcher for the smooth functioning of the grid, especially with a huge renewable capacity where intermittency of generation is a major issue in the offing.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The rollout of the proposed amendments through a consensus-based approach would go a long way in overhauling the weakest link in the nation’s power supply chain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Electricity Bill 2022 is a remedy worse than the disease afflicting India’s power sector. Critically analyse.</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>United Nations World Water Development Report of 2022 has expressed global concern over the sharp rise in freshwater withdrawal from streams, lakes, aquifers and human made reservoirs, significant water stress and also water scarcity being experienced in diﬀerent parts of the world.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Who publishes the UNs world water development report?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The United Nations World Water Development Report (WWDR) is published by UNESCO, on behalf of UN-Water and its production is coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Program (WWAP).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the level of <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-water-crisis/#:~:text=Nearly%20600%20million%20Indians%20faced,million%20people%2C%20the%20study%20noted.">water stress</a> in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Global Drought Risk and Water Stress map (2019)</strong>: It shows that major parts of India, particularly west, central and parts of peninsular India are highly water stressed and experience water scarcity.</li>
<li><strong>Composite Water Management Index (2018):</strong> Released by Niti Aayog indicates that more than 600 million people are facing acute water stress.</li>
<li><strong>India is the world’s largest extractor of groundwater</strong>: Accounting for 25 per cent of the total. 70 percent of our water sources are contaminated and our major rivers are dying because of pollution.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="water stress" class="alignnone wp-image-636155" height="304" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/108205197_gettyimages-1152798478-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/108205197_gettyimages-1152798478-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/108205197_gettyimages-1152798478-768x511.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/108205197_gettyimages-1152798478.jpg 976w" width="456"/>Why is Rural to Urban transfer of water becoming an issue in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising urban population: </strong>According to Census 2011, the urban population in India accounted for 34% of total population. It is estimated that the urban population component in India will cross the 40% mark by 2030 and the 50% mark by 2050 according to World Urbanization Prospects, 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Water use in the urban areas: </strong>Water use in the urban sector has increased as more and more people shift to urban areas. Per capita use of water in these centers rises, which will continue to grow with improved standards of living.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting of water source in Urban areas: </strong>As the city grows and water management infrastructures develop, dependence shifts to surface water from groundwater. <strong>For example:</strong> In Ahmedabad, more than 80% of water supply used to be met from groundwater sources till the mid-1980s. Due to such overexploitation of groundwater the depth to groundwater level reached 67 meters in confined aquifers. The city now depends on the Narmada canal for the bulk of its water supply.</li>
<li><strong>Dependence of urban areas on rural areas for water source and rural-urban disputes over water: </strong>Cities largely depend on rural areas for raw water supply, which has the potential to ignite the rural-urban dispute. For example: Nagpur and Chennai face the problem of rural-urban water disputes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Diversion of resource</strong>: Water is transported to urban areas at the expense of rural areas. Due to the high population in urban areas the water requirement for daily use is very high.</li>
<li><strong>High demand of water for industrial purposes: </strong>In urban areas the water is heavily used in industries creating water stress.</li>
<li><strong>High Agriculture dependence:</strong> In the rural areas water is used mainly for irrigation purposes and due to heavy dependence on agriculture the water is very essential in rural areas.</li>
<li><strong>Water pollution</strong>: In cities, most of this water is in the form of grey water with little recovery or reuse, eventually contributing to water pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Bad governance</strong>: Politicization of water for vote bank and skewed distribution of water particular regions For example: Andhra and Telangana.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Affecting rainfall pattern: </strong>Climate change affects the amount of rainfall in the region which is the prime source of both surface water and groundwater.</li>
<li><strong>Increase rate of evaporation over surface water:</strong> because of high temperature the surface waters of lakes, rivers, canals etc. face high evaporation water loss.</li>
<li><strong>Melting of glaciers: </strong>glaciers are the sources for perennial rivers of India. Due to global warming, glaciers are melting and hence affecting the perennial nature of rivers.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent droughts:</strong> It affects the groundwater recharge process and drying of surface waters which creates shortage of water. It exacerbate the rural-urban conflict.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A system perspective and catchment scale based approach are necessary to link reallocation of water with wider discussions on development, infrastructure investment, fostering an rural-urban partnership and adopting an integrated approach in water management.</li>
<li>The government cannot manage the water crisis alone. It will take the combined efforts of civil society, the private sector including the public at large to meet the challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rural and urban areas use water from the same stock, i.e., the water resources of the country. Therefore, it is important to strive for a win- win situation by securing the interests of both urban and rural areas. Good Governance is the key to achieve such a win-win situation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>India, belonging to the medium HDI category, shows dimensional inequalities similar to or slightly below the average figures in the category, except in the case of education where it is high and closer to the low HDI countries. The inequalities in health and education are more than twice that of the very high and high HDI categories.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why in news?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The bad news for <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/story/human-development-report-by-undp/">India is that its global HDI rank has slipped</a> from 129 in 2019 to 131 in 2020 and to 132 in 2021-22.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the meaning of human development?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Human development is defined as the process of enlarging people’s freedoms and opportunities and improving their well-being. Human development is about the real freedom ordinary people have to decide who to be, what to do, and how to live.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is meant by Human Development Index?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The HDI is a summary measure of human development. The HDI is a summary composite measure of a country’s average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health, knowledge and standard of living.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Who publishes HDI?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Human Development Report (HDR) is an annual Human Development Index report published by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="HDI" class="alignnone wp-image-636170" height="338" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ht-metro-ht-navi-mumbai_f11feabc-b82c-11e8-bbaf-ff4d73ce44e3-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ht-metro-ht-navi-mumbai_f11feabc-b82c-11e8-bbaf-ff4d73ce44e3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ht-metro-ht-navi-mumbai_f11feabc-b82c-11e8-bbaf-ff4d73ce44e3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ht-metro-ht-navi-mumbai_f11feabc-b82c-11e8-bbaf-ff4d73ce44e3.jpg 960w" width="600"/>Dimensions of the Human Development Index</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long and healthy life: </strong>The long and healthy life dimension is measured by life expectancy at birth. The life expectancy at birth is a statistical measure that an average individual is expected to live based on certain demographic factors such as the year of birth and current age.</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>: This is a second dimension in the HDI. The indicators of education are the expected years of schooling and the mean years of schooling. According to the UN, the average maximum years of schooling is 18 years, while the mean maximum years of schooling is 15 years.</li>
<li><strong>Standard of living: </strong>The standard of living is usually measured by the gross national income (GNI) per capita. The GNI indicates the total domestic and foreign output created by the residents of a certain country.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are the 4 indicators of HDI?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Mean years of schooling</li>
<li>Expected years of schooling</li>
<li>Life expectancy at birth</li>
<li>Gross national income (GNI) per capita</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Which Countries Have the Highest HDI?</strong></p>
<p>In the latest HDI ranking, from 2022, Switzerland finished first with an HDI value of 0.962.</p></blockquote>

<h4><strong>Issues in HDI</strong></h4>
<p><strong>(1) An incomplete indicator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Human development is incomplete without human freedom and that while the need for qualities judgement is clear; there is no simple quantitative measure available yet to capture the many aspects of human freedom.</li>
<li>HDI also does not specifically reflect quality of life factors, such as empowerment movements or overall feelings of security or happiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Limited idea of development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HDI is not reflecting the human development idea accurately.</li>
<li>It is an index restricted to the socio-economic sphere of life; the political and civil spheres are in the most part kept separate.</li>
<li>Hence there is a sub-estimation of inequality among countries, which means that this dimension is not being taken into consideration appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) A vague concept</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concerning data quality and the exact construction of the index HDI is conceptually weak and empirically unsound.</li>
<li>This strong critic comes from the idea that both components of HDI are problematic. The GNP in developing countries suffers from incomplete coverage, measurement errors and biases.</li>
<li>The definition and measurement of literacy are different among countries and also, this data has not been available since 1970 in a significant number of countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Data quality issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HDI, as a combination of only four relatively simple indicators, doesn’t only raise a questions what other indicators should be included, but also how to ensure quality and comparable input data.</li>
<li>It is logical that the UNDP try to collect their data from international organizations concentrating in collecting data in specific fields.</li>
<li>Quality and trustworthiness of those data is disputable, especially when we get the information from UN non-democratic members, as for example Cuba or China.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5) A tool for mere comparison</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of HDI was set up mainly for relative comparison of countries in one particular time.</li>
<li>HDI is much better when distinguishing between countries with low and middle human development, instead of countries at the top of the ranking.</li>
<li>Therefore, the original notion was not to set up an absolute ranking, but let’s quite free hands in comparison of the results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(6) Development has to be greener</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The human development approach has not adequately incorporated environmental conditions which may threaten long-term achievements on human development. The most pervasive failure was on environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>However, for the first time in 2020, the UNDP introduced a new metric to reflect the impact caused by each country’s per-capita carbon emissions and its material footprint.</li>
<li>This is Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI or PHDI. It measured the amount of fossil fuels, metals and other resources used to make the goods and services it consumes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(7) Wealth can never equate welfare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher national wealth does not indicate welfare. GNI may not necessarily increase economic welfare; it depends on how it is spent.</li>
<li>For example, if a country spends more on military spending – this is reflected in higher GNI, but welfare could actually be lower.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Importance of HDI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multidimensionality</strong>: It is one of the few multidimensional indices as it includes indicators such as literacy rate, enrolment ratio, life expectancy rate, infant mortality rate, etc.</li>
<li><strong>True yardstick</strong>: It acts as a true yardstick to measure development in real sense.</li>
<li><strong>Helps in measuring a nation’s well-being:</strong> Unlike per capital income, which only indicates that a rise in per capital income implies economic development; HDI considers many other vital social indicators and helps in measuring a nation’s well-being.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Value addition line</strong></p>
<p><em>People are the real wealth of a nation. The basic objective of development should be to create an enabling environment for people to live long, healthy and creative lives. This may appear to be a simple truth.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>To sum up, the introduction of the HDI three decades ago was an early attempt to address the shortcomings in conventional measures of wellbeing.</li>
<li>The HDI has continued to attract widespread attention and motivates the work of activists, scholars and political leaders around the world.</li>
<li>The HDI compels us to ask what matters more, the quantitative expansion of an economy, or the qualitative improvement in the capabilities of society.</li>
<li>Indeed the revival of interest in this subject at the highest levels of government is the need of the hour.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you understand by human development? Critically analyse the human development index given by UNDP.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>India will be facing the immediate challenge –The ageing of the population. Challenge to ensure a decent quality of life for the old age people in the near future, planning and providing for it must begin today.</p>
<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy in India has more than doubled since Independence from around 32 years in the late 1940s to 70 years or so today, a historical achievement.</li>
<li>Over the same period, the fertility rate has crashed from about six children per woman to just two, which liberated women from the cycle of continuous child bearing and child care.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is ageing of the population?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning: </strong>Population ageing is a shift in the distribution of a country’s population towards older ages.</li>
<li><strong>Reason behind it</strong>: Decline in the fertility rate and Rise In the life expectancy. An increase in longevity increases the average age of the population by increasing the numbers of surviving older people.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of the ageing population:</strong>, labor supply shortage, change in patterns of saving and investment, deteriorate fiscal balance, lack of adequate welfare system etc.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges they impose: </strong>Social security, elderly Healthcare, Dependence on the family etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the status in India?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>According to the National Commission on Population, The share of the elderly (persons aged 60 years and above) close to 9% in 2011.</li>

<h4>Which tribes are we talking about?</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Hatti </u></strong>tribe in the Trans-Giri area of Sirmour district in Himachal Pradesh</li>

<h4>Other tribes in news</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Cabinet also approved ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Betta-Kuruba</strong></span>’ as a synonym for the Kadu Kuruba tribe In Karnataka.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who are the Scheduled Tribes?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The term ‘<a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/mains/what-is-the-reason-for-special-provisions-for-the-scheduled-tribes-in-the-constitution-of-india-are-these-provisions-successful-in-ameliorating-their-conditions-250-words/">Scheduled Tribes’</a> first appeared in the Constitution of India.</li>
<li><strong><u>Article 366 (25)</u></strong> defined scheduled tribes as “such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this constitution”.</li>
<li><strong><u>Article 342</u></strong> prescribes procedure to be followed in the matter of specification of scheduled tribes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The government will announce the National Logistics Policy (NLP) this week, aiming to bring down logistics costs and address challenges plaguing importers and exporters.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Logistics? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Logistics refers to the overall process of managing <strong><u>how resources are acquired, stored, and transported</u></strong> to their final destination.</li>
<li>It involves identifying prospective distributors and suppliers and determining their effectiveness and accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why need a logistics policy?</strong></h4>
<p><img alt="logistics" class="alignnone wp-image-636220" height="273" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/logist-300x187.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/logist-300x187.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/logist-768x479.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/logist-400x250.jpg 400w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/logist.jpg 827w" width="438"/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizing and consolidating the sector:</strong> India’s logistics sector is largely unorganized and fragmented.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing logistics cost:</strong> This is why the country’s logistics costs are as high as 14-15% of the GDP, against 7-8% in developed nations such as the Singapore and the US, who leverage it to boost exports. The NLP aims to bring down India’s logistics cost to 8% in the next five years.</li>
<li><strong>Preventing waste of perishable items:</strong> As per some estimates in India, about 16% of agri-production is wasted at different stages of the supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Warehousing development:</strong> Moreover, due to factors such as limited capacity and availability of warehouses, the cost of transaction increases.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-modal integration:</strong> The new policy is going about simplification, technology and will have a multimodal approach that will combine rail, water, and air — all modes of transport.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What role will technology play?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced analytics:</strong> The NLP will aim to harness technologies such as AI and blockchain. It aims to create a data analytics centre for driving greater transparency and continuous monitoring of key logistics metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Single window portal:</strong> Under NLP, a portal will be created, where service providers such as warehousing providers, shipping experts, transporters, customs brokers, and various governmental agencies will be unified.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Will it boost cooperation between ministries?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unifying multiple departments:</strong> Currently, the logistics value chain is managed by several ministries—road transport and highways, shipping, railways, and civil aviation.</li>
<li><strong>Single-point clearances:</strong> Agencies like the Central Drug Standard Control Organization and the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India provide clearances.</li>
<li><strong>Nationwide integration:</strong> The NLP could enhance their integration at the central level.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What about reducing the carbon footprint?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy-efficient transportation:</strong> The draft logistics policy lays emphasis on the shift to more energy-efficient means of transportation, as well as the use of greener fuels which could reduce the supply chain’s carbon footprint.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicular emission reduction:</strong> Moreover, the draft policy, released earlier, emphasized creating regulations for controlling vehicular noise, emissions, and wastage.</li>
<li><strong>Green warehousing principles:</strong> The new logistics policy also aims to incorporate green principles in the functioning of warehouses which contribute to nearly 10% of the logistics costs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Will it change India’s commodity transport?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transport of crucial commodities:</strong> The proposed policy aims to focus on the transport of crucial commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore, food grains, steel, cement, fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Creating nationwide clusters:</strong> The current logistical network for transporting them is mainly confined to regional clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating national supply-chains:</strong> The NLP could help establish a link between the place of origin, and destination place and integrate the supply on a national level.</li>
<li><strong>Optimum logistics identification:</strong> The draft also proposes identification of the right mode of transport for each of these commodities to minimise losses during transport.</li>
</ul>

<p>Union Home Minister has appealed to guardians to speak to children in their mother tongue to enable them to learn Hindi without much effort, on the Hindi Divas.</p>
<h4>What did HM say on Hindi?</h4>
<ul>
<li>He said it was time that <strong><u>inferiority complex around Indian languages</u></strong>, instilled by the British, was overthrown from people’s conscience with the help of regional languages and Hindi.</li>
<li>He also said that <strong><u>Hindi was not a competitor but a “friend” of all the other regional languages</u></strong> in the country and they were mutually dependent on each other for their growth.</li>
<li>He said there was a concerted <strong><u>disinformation campaign to pit Hindi against other languages</u></strong> such as Marathi and Tamil, and underlined the need to strengthen local languages with Hindi.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Debate over Hindi</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Between September 12 and 14, 1949, that the Constituent Assembly debated the status of India’s languages.</li>
<li>Among the issues that were discussed were the use of the term ‘<a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-national-language-debate/">national language’</a> instead of ‘official’ language.</li>
<li>Hindi author Seth Govind Das, who represented the Central Provinces and Berar, argued for ‘one language and one script’ and suggested that Hindi should replace English at the earliest.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the status of Hindi?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Finally, the Constituent Assembly adopted what was known as “<strong><u>Munshi-Ayyangar Formula</u></strong>.”</li>
<li>According to this, Hindi in the Devnagari script would be the official language of the Union.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Official, not national</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>English would continue to be used for all official purposes for the next 15 years, to enable a smooth transition for non-Hindi speaking states.</li>
<li>The deadline was 26 January 1965.</li>
<li>Under Article 343 of the Constitution, the official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script.</li>
<li>The international form of Indian numerals will be used for official purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why has language become a sensitive issue?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-identification:</strong> A strong identification with one’s regional language and an underlying fear of homogenisation is at the heart of the national language question in India. An individual conceptualises and communicates his thoughts in a language, enabling him to be an active part of society.</li>
<li><strong>Language defines primary group:</strong> People identify with one another based on language, thus giving them a primary group. A nation is the largest primary group that once can address.</li>
<li><strong>Learning abilities at stake:</strong> The dangers of imposing a language are manifold. It can affect the learning ability of non-native speakers thereby affecting their self-confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Threats to endangered languages:</strong> It can also endanger other languages and dialects and reduce diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Threats to diversity:</strong> National integration cannot come at the cost of people’s linguistic identities. Language is integral to culture and therefore privileging Hindi over all other languages spoken in India takes away from its diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Promises made by Constituent Assembly:</strong> Then PM Pt. Nehru had promised that Hindi would only serve as a linking language and it would not be imposed on non-Hindi speaking states as long as they were against it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Benefits of having a national language</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wide range of speakers:</strong> Hindi is still the most widely spoken language in the country with an estimated 258 million people declaring that Hindi is their native language and millions more comfortable with Hindi.</li>
<li><strong>Language as a unifying language:</strong> A complete usage of Hindi language whilst respecting the various native languages would also ensure better coordination and cooperation among all the states and act as a strong unifying factor and eliminate all regional differences.</li>
<li><strong>Reputation at international fora:</strong> When countries like Germany, Japan, France, Italy etc. use their respective language as a medium of communication even during International forums not only has the reputation of those countries have greatly enhanced but also those languages have gained a huge reputation worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Issues with Hindi</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inherent opposition to Hindi:</strong> The Constituent Assembly was bitterly divided on the question, with members from States that did not speak Hindi initially opposing the declaration of Hindi as a national language.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of imposition:</strong> Opponents were against English being done away with, fearing that it may lead to Hindi domination in regions that did not speak the language.</li>
<li><strong>Symbol of identity politics:</strong> The approach towards linguistic policy seems to be driven more by the politics of identity than values of aspiration or accommodation.</li>
<li><strong>Favour for majoritarianism:</strong> The primary argument in favour of Hindi has been reduced to assertions of slim majoritarianism.</li>
<li><strong>Few speakers, still dominant:</strong> Even then, there are concerns about the claim based on mere numerical strength, as only 25 per cent of Indians seem to recognise Hindi as their mother tongue (Census 2011).</li>
<li><strong>Demographic barriers:</strong> Today nearly 35% of people are migrating daily for work. In such a situation, we have to conceptualise a new form of language identity for our states.</li>
<li><strong>Economic barriers:</strong> Any idea of one link language, whether Hindi or English, will be economically disastrous for India. It will slow down migration and reduce the ease of capital flow.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple dialects:</strong> Only five states in India have Hindi as their’ native language’. However, in those states, too, the dialects of Hindi are associated with locals and their communities.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why Hindi cannot be the national language?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple dialects:</strong> Hindi has largely been influenced by Persian — and then English, among other languages. Also, when the languages were enumerated, Hindi subsumed Bhojpuri, which is spoken by a little over five crore people.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inefficacy of Sanskrit:</strong> There were demands to make Sanskrit the official language, while some argued in favour of ‘Hindustani’.</li>
<li><strong>Issue over Script:</strong> There were differences of opinion over the script too. When opinion veered towards accepting Hindi, proponents of the language wanted the ‘Devanagari’ script to be adopted both for words and numerals.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why this issue needs a rational consideration?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linguistic chauvinism:</strong> Various policies on language have been framed both by the central and state governments that have been termed as forms of linguistic chauvinism.  Ex. Obsession for Marathi in Mumbai</li>
<li><strong>Secular fabric under threat:</strong> The states’ fear of the central government’s ideology of monopolising faith, education, and language will adversely affect the Indian political system, which is based on pluralism and accommodation.</li>
<li><strong>Monolingualism can prove disastrous: </strong>If there is a mechanical and monolithic idea of unity followed by any entity, such an entity generally generates great hostility beyond its immediate borders.  In neighbouring Bangladesh – then East Pakistan – the language movement against the imposition of Urdu on Bengali speakers was a key driver of Pakistan splitting into two nations.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language as a skill:</strong> Language should be looked at as an important skill to operate in a world which is more connected today than at any other point in time.</li>
<li><strong>Language not a cultural burden:</strong> A united nation has to have space for diversity. India is united in its diversity. Diversity is a great philosophical idea and should never be seen as a cultural burden.</li>
<li><strong>Linguistic heritage needs priority:</strong> This is not to contend that our linguistic heritage should be neglected or trivialised. Our metropolises must be recognized as multilingual entities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Centralized procurement of 5,450 electric buses and subsequent increase in ambition to have 50,000 e-buses on the country’s roads by 2030 under FAME scheme.</li>
<li>With the shared aim to rapidly electrify a key pillar of India’s public transportation, recent governance efforts of Union and state governments have created a new business model for e-buses.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Status of State-owned buses</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: There are currently around 1,40,000 registered public buses on India’s roads.</li>
<li><strong>Condition</strong>: Large numbers of them having sputtering engines which emits planet-warming fumes into the atmosphere. At least 40,000 of these buses are at the end of their lifespan and must be taken off the roads</li>
<li><strong>Operators:</strong> Most buses are owned and operated by State transport undertakings, which are in poor financial health.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue loss:</strong> They incur large losses because of the subsidized fares to crores of Indians each day.</li>
<li><strong>Problem: </strong>problems of fragmented demand and high prices.</li>
<li><strong>Limitation:</strong> As State governments control issues such as transit, urban governance and pollution control so there’s a limitation for the nation-wide action on this issue.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>The National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020</strong>: Is a National Mission document providing the vision and the roadmap for the faster adoption of electric vehicles and their manufacturing in the country.</li>
<li><strong>FAME</strong>: As part of the NEMMP 2020, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a Scheme viz. <strong>Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &amp;) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India)</strong> Scheme in the year 2015 to promote manufacturing of electric and hybrid vehicle technology and to ensure sustainable growth of the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/pib-technical-analysis-of-fame-ii-scheme/"><strong>FAME Phase-II</strong>:</a> Government has approved Phase-II of FAME Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 10,000 Crore for a period of 3 years commencing from 1st April 2019.</li>
<li>Out of total budgetary support, about 86 percent of fund has been allocated for Demand Incentive so as to create demand for EVs in the country.</li>
<li>This phase aims to generate demand by way of supporting 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars (including Strong Hybrid) and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. However, depending upon off-take of different category of EVs, these numbers may vary as the provision has been made for inter as well as intra segment wise f</li>
<li>Incentives: Only advanced battery and registered vehicles will be incentivized under the scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage</strong>: With greater emphasis on providing affordable &amp; environment friendly public transportation options for the masses, scheme will be applicable mainly to vehicles used for public transport or those registered for commercial purposes in e-3W, e-4W and e-bus segments. However, privately owned registered e-2Ws are also covered under the scheme as a mass segment.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img alt="FAME" class="alignnone wp-image-636656" height="452" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imgonline-com-ua-CompressToSize-CuDyNCv0Aqi9-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imgonline-com-ua-CompressToSize-CuDyNCv0Aqi9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/imgonline-com-ua-CompressToSize-CuDyNCv0Aqi9.jpg 640w" width="603"/>Obstacles in electric vehicle mobility </strong></p>
<p><strong>   EV Cost and Battery cost:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The cost is the most concerning point for an individual when it comes to buying an electric vehicle.</li>
<li>However, there are many incentives given off by central and state governments. But the common condition in all policies is that the incentives are only applicable for up to a certain number of vehicles only and after removing the discount and incentives the same EV which was looking lucrative to buy suddenly becomes unaffordable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>   Beta version of vehicles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, both the technology and companies are new to the market and the products they are manufacturing are possibly facing real costumers for the first time.</li>
<li>It’s nearly impossible to make such a complex product like an automobile perfect for the customers in the first go, and as expected the buyers faced many issues. Vehicles like RV400, EPluto 7G, Nexon all them has to update their vehicle up to a very high extent after customer feedback and reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>   Poor Infrastructure and range anxiety:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Poor infrastructure is among the most pressing issue among people thinking to opt for electric vehicles.</li>
<li>Poor infra doesn’t only include a lack of charging stations but also the lack of proper charging set up in their home.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> No Universal charger and Ecosystem (Lack of standardization):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every second electric vehicle-making company has its own different charging port which is becoming a hurdle to setting up a proper charging ecosystem.</li>
<li>Also, many EV users complained about facing moral trouble for charging their vehicle in different EV-making Company’s charging stations which can impact the growth of the EV industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>   Temperature Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature can affect the performance of an EV battery at a large extent which makes EV’s inappropriate for too cold (Uttarakhand, Meghalaya) or too hot regions like (Rajasthan, Kerala). The battery can give its ideal performance when it’s in use under the temperature range of 15-40 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>   Environmental concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The EV revolution is necessary for the most populated and polluted parts of India like Delhi, Mumbai, etc. but in such cities the major chunk of electricity is generated through burning fossil fuels which are equivalent to spreading the pollution through the ICE vehicle smoke, even most of the charging stations are reportedly operating upon diesel-driven electricity generator.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With anything new, there will always be challenges.</li>
<li>The EV industry is still in a nascent stage in India but developing at a rapid pace. Catching up to speed are the infrastructure requirements to support the EV demand.</li>
<li>Even with the current challenges, electric vehicles present huge potential to reduce our carbon footprints and provide a cost-effective system of transportation.</li>
<li>And one way to contribute towards this growth is to buy an electric vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In the recent monsoon session of Parliament (July-August) the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022 sent to the Parliamentary Committees for detailed examination and a report thereon.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Parliament had only limited legislative time this session and could pass only five pieces of legislation</li>
<li><strong>Oppositions stand:</strong> opposition alleging that the Government has been trying to steamroll various pieces of legislation in the last few sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Governments stand:</strong> Government worries that so much time is lost in disruptions in Parliament that the legislative process, as it is, becomes unduly delayed and therefore, referring the bills to the Standing Committees.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Parliamentary Committees" class="alignnone wp-image-636703" height="415" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/loks888-16599611063x2-1-300x200.jpeg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/loks888-16599611063x2-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/loks888-16599611063x2-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/loks888-16599611063x2-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/loks888-16599611063x2-1.jpeg 1200w" width="623"/>Parliamentary Committees</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need of parliamentary committees</strong>: The functions of the Parliament are varied, complex and voluminous. Moreover, it has neither the adequate time nor necessary expertise to make a detailed scrutiny of all legislative measures.</li>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: To assist parliament to discharge of its duties.</li>
<li><strong>Mandate:</strong> To examine various legislations referred to it, the budget proposals of different Ministries, and also to do policy thinking on the vision, mission and future direction of the Ministries concerned.</li>
<li><strong>Composition</strong>: Members of the Parliament of both the LokSabha and the RajyaSabha in the ratio 2:1,</li>
<li><strong>Authority</strong>: constituted by the Speaker of the LokSabha and the Chairman of the RajyaSabha, jointly.</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Broadly, two kinds–Standing Committees and <em>Ad Hoc </em> Standing Committees are permanent (constituted every year or periodically) and work on a continuous basis, while<em> Ad Hoc </em>Committees are temporary and cease to exist on completion of the task assigned to them.</li>
<li><strong>Parliament has 24 Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees (DRSC).</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Relevance of parliamentary committees </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawal of farm law bills shows that if bills are not discussed thoroughly, these laws are just bizarre pieces of legislation from point of view consumers and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Parliamentary committee’s discussions are held closed door. Members can express their opinion freely.</li>
<li>Members of DRSC always try reach to consensus despite political differences. Such practices are essential for healthy democracy.</li>
<li>To strengthen the relevance of parliamentarians the parliamentary committees are crucial tools.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Parliamentary Committees" class="alignnone wp-image-636704" height="402" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tab1-300x195.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tab1-300x195.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tab1.jpg 700w" width="619"/>How to improve Efficacy of committees?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compulsory process: </strong>The Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha have powers to refer Bills to a DRSC of Parliament. Making the process of reference of Bills to these committees compulsory/an automatic process will be useful. An exemption could be made with the specific approval of the Speaker/ Chairman after detailed reasons for the same.</li>
<li><strong>No whip: </strong>All discussions in the Parliamentary Standing Committee should be frank and free. No whip of the party would apply to them during the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Time bound:</strong> fixed timeline to come up with the recommendation and present its report which can be decided by the Speaker/Chairman. In case the committee if fails to give its recommendation within the approved/extended time, the Bill may be put up before the House concerned directly.</li>
<li><strong>Inviting filed Expertise:</strong> To ensure quality work in the committees, experts in the field may be invited who could bring with them the necessary domain knowledge and also help introduce the latest developments and trends in that field from Some subject matter experts/young researchers could be associated with the committee for a short period would be fruitful.</li>
<li><strong>Authority</strong>: The Speaker/Chairman should have the right to fix a time limit, sometimes even stringent, if the government of the day asks for it and the demand is found to be reasonable by the Speaker/Chairman.</li>
<li><strong>Organized work in the gap: </strong>Between two sessions, there is generally enough time to organise committee meetings for discussions on Bills in the parliamentary committees. It is important for the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs in collaboration with the committee chairmen to get these parliamentary works organized during the intersessional period, in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Other than Budget Proposals</strong>: The committees should not limit themselves to discussing just the budget proposals and endorsing them with a few qualifications here or amendments there. They should also come up with suggestions for the Ministry to take up new initiatives and people friendly measures.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Discussion is not a stumbling block but an indispensable preliminary of any wise actions.</li>
<li>Discussion is soul of democracy.</li>
<li>Parliamentary committees are truly democratic institutions in India due to its consensus and bonhomie while functioning.</li>
<li>Government of the day should take step to strengthen DRSC and refer more bills to committees.<strong> </strong></li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>PMAY- Urban and Rural</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Housing for All</p></div></div><p>Pulling up the States for the delay in completion of the government’s flagship rural household scheme — Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana –Gramin (PMAY-G) — the Union Ministry of Rural Development has come up with a set of penalties that the State governments will have to bear for any further delay.</p>
<h4>About PMAY-G Scheme</h4>
<ul>
<li>In pursuance of the goal – Housing for all by 2022, the rural housing scheme <strong><u>Indira Awas Yojana was revamped</u></strong> to PMAY-G and approved during March 2016.</li>
<li>The main aim of the PMAY-G scheme is to provide pucca house with some of the basic amenities.</li>
<li>This scheme is meant for people who do not own a house and people who live in kutcha houses or houses which are severely damaged.</li>
<li>At present, the minimum size of the houses to be built under the PMAY-G scheme has been increased to 25 sq. mt. from 20 sq. mt.</li>
<li>Under PMAY, the cost of unit assistance is to be shared between Central and State Governments in the ratio 60:40 in plain areas and 90:10 for North Eastern and hilly states.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Subsidies under PMAY – G scheme</h4>
<p>There are various subsidies offered under PMAY G. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loans up to Rs. 70,000 from financial institution</li>
<li>Interest subsidy of 3%</li>
<li>Subsidy for the maximum principal amount is Rs. 2 lakh</li>
</ul>
<p>Why in news?</p>
<ul>
<li>Opposition-ruled states such as West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha are the leading four States who are far behind their targets.</li>
<li>The initial deadline for the scheme was March 2022, which owing to the COVID-19 pandemic was extended by another two years till March 2024.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the penalty provisions?</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the sanction of the house is <strong><u>delayed for more than one month</u></strong> from the date of issue of the target, the State government will be penalised.</li>
<li>The penal fees are <strong><u>per week</u></strong> <strong><u>₹10 per house</u></strong> for the first month of delay and ₹20 per house for each subsequent month of delay.</li>
<li>Similarly, if the first instalment due to the beneficiary is delayed for more than seven days from the date of sanction, then the State governments will have to pay <strong><u>₹10 per house per week of delay</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Big cats</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>NA</p></div></div><p><strong><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-636710" height="394" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/panthera-300x271.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/panthera-300x271.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/panthera.jpg 633w" width="436"/></strong></p>
<p>We often get confused to differentiate between Cheetah/Bagh/Sher/Puli. The cheetah, which is being re-introduced to India from Africa, is not to be confused with the leopard, which too has spots that look somewhat similar.</p>
<h4><strong>How are all Big Cats differentiated?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>[A] Genus Panthera</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the genus of large wild cats that can roar but can’t purr.</li>
<li>Among them, the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar are more closely related, while the other strand has the tiger and the snow leopard.</li>
<li>The snow leopard is an exception to the rest of the group in that it can’t roar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Tiger <em>(Panthera Tigris)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 75-300 kg | IUCN status : Endangered</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jim Corbett’s “large-hearted gentleman with boundless courage”, the solitary and strongly territorial tiger is the largest of all wild cats and also the earliest Panthera member to exist.</li>
<li>Primarily a forest animal, they range from the Siberian taiga to the Sunderban delta.</li>
<li>The national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea, the tiger was voted the world’s favourite animal ahead of the dog in a 2004 Animal Planet global online poll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Lion <em>(Panthera Leo</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 100-250 kg | IUCN status: Vulnerable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Native to Africa and Asia, the lion is the most social cat, and lives in groups called prides.</li>
<li>They prefer open forests such as scrubland, and adult males have a prominent mane.</li>
<li>The lion is arguably the most widely recognised animal symbol in human culture — be it the Ashoka pillar in Sarnath, the main entrance to Buckingham Palace, or the 20th Century Fox and MGM logo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> <strong>Jaguar<em> (Panthera Onca)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 50-110 kg | IUCN status: Near Threatened</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The largest cat in the Americas, the Jaguar has the strongest bite force of all wild cats, enabling it to bite directly through the skull of its prey.</li>
<li>Melanistic (black) Jaguars are common and are often called black panthers.</li>
<li>Jaguar was a powerful motif in the Mayan and Aztec civilisations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Leopard<em> (Panthera Pardus)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 30-90 kg | IUCN status: Vulnerable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar in appearance to the Jaguar with a rosette patterned coat, the leopard was described by Jim Corbett as “the most beautiful of all animals” for its “grace of movement and beauty of colouring”.</li>
<li>The most adaptable of all big cats, they occupy diverse habitats at all altitudes across Africa and Asia.</li>
<li>Like black jaguars, melanistic leopards are called black panthers.</li>
<li>In some African cultures, leopards are considered to be better hunters than lions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> <strong>Snow leopard <em>(Panthera Uncia)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 25-55 kg | IUCN status : Vulnerable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ghost of the mountains, this smokey-grey cat lives above the snow line in Central and South Asia.</li>
<li>The most elusive of all big cats, it cannot roar, and has the longest tail of them all — which comes in handy for balance while hunting along the cliffs, and also gives warmth when wrapped around the body.</li>
<li>The snow leopard is the state animal of Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>[B] Genus Puma</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Closely related to the domestic cat, this genus has only one extant species, the cougar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cougar <em>(Puma concolor)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 40-100 kg | IUCN status: Least Concern</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The cougar is the second-largest cat in the Americas. (The Jaguar is the largest.)</li>
<li>Cougars are also called ‘mountain lion’ and ‘panther’ across their range from the Canadian Yukon to the Southern Andes.</li>
<li>Concolor is latin for “of uniform colour”. The Incas designed the city of Cusco in the shape of a cougar.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>[C] Genus Acinonyx</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a unique genus within the cat family, with only one living member, the cheetah.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cheetah<em> (Acinonyx jubatus)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Size: 20-70 kg | IUCN status: Vulnerable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The fastest land mammal, the cheetah is the only cat without retractable claws — the grip helps it accelerate faster than any sports car (0-100 km/hr in 3 seconds).</li>
<li>Cheetahs are not aggressive towards humans, and they have been tamed since the Sumerian era.</li>
<li>They don’t breed well in captivity — picky females play hard to get.</li>
<li>Cheetahs are not really big, and they hunt during the day to avoid competing with other big cats.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tamil Nadu CM has launched the Chief Minister’s Breakfast Scheme for students of Class I to V in government schools.</p>
<h4><strong>CM’s Breakfast Scheme</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The scheme covers around 1.14 lakh students in 1,545 schools which include 417 municipal corporation schools, 163 municipality schools and 728 taluk and village panchayat-level schools.</li>
<li>The inauguration of the scheme marks an important milestone in the State’s history of providing <strong><u>free meals to school students.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>How has the idea evolved?</h4>
<p><strong>(a) Pre-independence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In November 1920, the Madras Corporation Council approved a proposal for providing tiffin to the students of a Corporation School at Thousand Lights at a cost not exceeding one anna per student per day.</li>
<li>Theagaraya Chetty, the then President of the Corporation and one of the stalwarts of the Justice Party, said the boys studying at the school were poor, which affected the strength of the institution ‘greatly’.</li>
<li>The scheme, which was extended to four more schools and facilitated higher enrollment of students.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Post-independence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept saw a <strong><u>Statewide application in 1956</u></strong> when the then CM K. Kamaraj decided to provide free noon meal to poor children in all primary schools across the State.</li>
<li>The Budget for 1956-57 contained a provision for supplying mid-day meals to schoolchildren for 200 days a year, initially covering 65,000 students in 1,300 feeding centres.</li>
<li>In July 1982, it was left to the then CM MG Ramachandran to extend the programme to children in the 2-5 age group in Anganwadis and those in 5-9 age group in primary schools in rural areas.</li>
<li>Subsequently, the scheme now called <strong><u>Puratchi Thalaivar MGR Nutritious Meal Programme</u></strong> — was extended to urban areas as well.</li>
<li>Since September 1984, students of standards VI to X have been covered under the scheme.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Beneficiaries of the programme</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As of now, there are nearly <strong><u>7 lakh beneficiaries</u></strong> spread over 43,190 nutritious meal centres.</li>
<li>This includes around 3,500 students of <strong><u>National Child Labour Project (NCLP)</u></strong> special schools.</li>
<li>Besides, as a consequence of the collaborative implementation of the <strong><u>Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)</u></strong> and the nutritious meal programme, around 15.8 lakh children in the age group of 2+ to 5+ years receive nutritious meals.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Impact on school education</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rise in enrolment:</strong> After the improved version of the mid-day meal scheme in 1982, the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) at primary level (standards I to V) went up by 10% during July-September, 1982 as compared to the corresponding period in 1981.</li>
<li><strong>Girls’ enrolment:</strong> The rise in boys’ enrollment was 12% and in the case of girls, 7%, according to a publication brought out by the Tamil Nadu government on the occasion of the launch of the Scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Increase in attendance:</strong> Likewise, attendance during July-September 1982 rose by 33% over the previous year’s figure.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Focus areas programme</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Anaemia</u></strong> is a major health problem in Tamil Nadu, especially among women and children, says the 2019-21 National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5’s report.</li>
<li>From 50% during the period of the 2015-16 NFHS-4, the prevalence of anaemia in children now went up to 57%.</li>
<li>This and many other health issues can be addressed through the combined efforts of the departments of School Education, Public Health and Social Welfare and Women Empowerment.</li>
<li>Besides, a continuous and rigorous review of the progress of the scheme and nutritious meal programme should be carried out in a sustained manner.</li>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>NA</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Medical education pursuance in foreign and issues</p></div></div><p><strong><img alt="medical" class="alignnone wp-image-636747" height="241" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ukr-300x180.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ukr-300x180.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ukr-768x461.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ukr.jpg 917w" width="402"/></strong></p>
<p>The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/national-medical-commission-replaces-the-mci/">law</a> does not allow undergraduate medical students, who fled the “war-like situation” in Ukraine, to be accommodated in Indian medical colleges.</p>
<h4><strong>Which laws is the govt talking about?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There are no provisions either under the <strong><u>Indian Medical Council Act, 1956</u></strong>, or the <strong><u>National Medical Commission Act, 2019</u></strong> to accommodate or transfer medical students.</li>
<li>Till now, no permission has been given by the National Medical Commission to transfer or accommodate any foreign medical students in any Indian medical institute/university.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why foreign undergraduates are not permitted?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absence of law:</strong> The extant regulations in India do not permit migration of students from foreign universities to India.</li>
<li><strong>No backdoor entry:</strong> The public notice cannot be used as a back door entry into Indian colleges offering undergraduate courses.</li>
<li><strong>Merit issue:</strong> The students had left for foreign universities for two reasons, poor marks in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and affordability of medical education in foreign countries.</li>
<li><strong>High cost:</strong> Besides, these students, if admitted in Indian colleges, would again face the problem of affordability.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why do Indians go abroad for medical studies?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>According to estimates from Ukraine, reported in the media, around 18,000 Indian students are in Ukraine (before Operation Ganga).</li>
<li>Most of them are pursuing medicine.</li>
<li>This war has turned the spotlight on something that has been the trend for about three decades now.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Preferred countries for a medical degree</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>For about three decades now, Indian students have been heading out to Russia, China, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Philippines to pursue a medical degree.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Hype of becoming a Doctor</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prestige:</strong> The desire to study medicine still holds a lot of value in the Indian community (the other is becoming an IAS officer).</li>
<li><strong>Shortages of Doctor:</strong> In many rural areas, people still look at doctors as god’s incarnate.</li>
<li><strong>Rarity of opportunity:</strong> The lack of equal opportunities exacerbated by the caste factor in the Indian context, has a great deal of impact on the prestige still associated with being a doctor.</li>
<li><strong>Social upliftment ladder:</strong> For years, certain communities were denied the opportunities, and finally they do have a chance at achieving significant educational status.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why do Indians prefer going abroad?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>No language barrier:</strong> The medium of education for these students is English, a language they are comfortable with.</li>
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> The amount spent on living and the medical degree are far more affordable than paying for an MBBS seat in private medical colleges in India.</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetics and foreign culture:</strong> People are willing to leave their home to study far away in much colder places and with completely alien cultures and food habits.</li>
<li><strong>Practice and OPD exposure:</strong> It broadens students’ mind and thinking, expose them to a whole range of experiences, and their approach to issues and crises is likely to be far better.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Doesn’t India have enough colleges?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>(a) More aspirants than seats</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are certainly far more MBBS aspirants than there are MBBS seats in India.</li>
<li>In NEET 2021, as per a National Testing Agency press release, 16.1 lakh students registered for the exam, 15.4 lakh students appeared for the test, and 8.7 lakh students qualified.</li>
<li>As per data from the National Medical Commission (NMC), in 2021-22, there were 596 medical colleges in the country with a total of 88,120 MBBS seats.</li>
<li>While the skew is in favour of Government colleges, it is not greatly so, with the number of private medical institutions nearly neck-to-neck with the state-run ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Fees structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That means over 50% of the total seats are available at affordable fees in Government colleges.</li>
<li>Add the 50% seats in the private sector that the NMC has mandated must charge only the government college fees.</li>
<li>In fully private colleges, the full course fees range from several lakhs to crores.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c) Uneven distribution of colleges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These colleges are also not distributed evenly across the country, with States such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala having many more colleges.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What about costs?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The cost factor on both sides of an MBBS degree is significant.</li>
<li>The costs of an MBBS degree in a Government college tot up to a few lakhs of rupees for the full course, but in a private medical college, <strong><u>it can go up to ₹1 crore</u></strong> <strong><u>for the five-year course</u></strong>.</li>
<li>In case it is a management seat, capitation fees can inflate the cost by several lakhs again.</li>
<li>Whereas, an MBBS course at any foreign medical university in the east and Eastern Europe costs far less (upto ₹30lakh-₹40 lakh).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>While PM Modi emphasised that more private medical colleges must be set up in the country to aid more people to take up MBBS, medical education experts have called for pause on the aspect.</li>
<li>If the aim is to make medicine more accessible to students of the country, the path ahead is not in the private sector, but in the public sector, with the Central and State governments’ involvement.</li>
<li>Starting private medical colleges by reducing the strict standards set for establishing institutes may not actually be the solution to this problem, if we think this is a concern.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Creating more medical colleges will be beneficial for the country, if access and availability can be ensured.</li>
<li>This will not be possible by resorting to private enterprise only.</li>
<li>The State and Central governments can start more medical colleges, as recommended by NITI Aayog, by utilising district headquarters hospitals, and expanding the infrastructure.</li>
<li>This way, students from the lower and middle socio-economic rung, who are otherwise not able to access medical seats, will also benefit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Russia hosted the seventh Eastern Economic Forum- EEF Vladivostok from September 5 to 8. The four-day forum is a platform for entrepreneurs to expand their businesses into Russia’s Far East (RFE).</p>
<h4><strong>What is the Eastern Economic Forum-EEF?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The EEF was <strong><u>established in 2015</u></strong> aiming <strong><u>to encourage foreign investments</u></strong> in the RFE to display:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Economic potential</li>
<li>Suitable business conditions and</li>
<li>Investment opportunities in the region</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus areas: </strong>The agreements focus on infrastructure, transportation projects, mineral excavations, construction, industry and agriculture.</li>
<li>With EEF, Russia is trying to attract the Asian economies in investing and developing the Far East.</li>
<li>This year, the Forum aimed at <strong><u>connecting the Far East with the Asia-Pacific</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does the EEF aim for?</strong></h4>
<p><strong><img alt="eef" class="alignnone wp-image-635634" height="237" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/far-east-300x162.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/far-east-300x162.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/far-east.jpg 750w" width="439"/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FDI inflows:</strong> The primary objective of the EEF is to increase the Foreign Direct Investments in the RFE.</li>
<li><strong>Natural resource exploitation:</strong> The region encompasses one-third of Russia’s territory and is rich with natural resources such as fish, oil, natural gas, wood, diamonds and other minerals.</li>
<li><strong>Demographic revamp:</strong> The sparse population living in the region is another factor for encouraging people to move and work in the Far East.</li>
<li><strong>Unleashing economic potential:</strong> The region’s riches and resources contribute to five percent of Russia’s GDP.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Success of EEF</strong></h4>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-636708" height="434" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eef-289x300.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eef-289x300.jpg 289w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eef.jpg 505w" width="418"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Agreements signed at the EEF increased from 217 in 2017 to 380 agreements in 2021, worth 3.6 trillion roubles.</li>
<li>As of 2022, almost 2,729 investment projects are being planned in the region.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Who are the major actors in the EEF? </strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>China is the biggest investor</u></strong> in the region as it sees potential in promoting the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative and the Polar Sea Route in the RFE.</li>
<li>China’s investments in the region account for <strong><u>90% of the total investments</u></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><u>South Korea</u></strong> has invested in shipbuilding projects, manufacturing of electrical equipment, gas-liquefying plants, agricultural production and fisheries.</li>
<li><strong><u>Japan</u></strong> is another key trading partner. In 2017, its investments through 21 projects amounted to $16 billion.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How does Russia see Chinese investment in EEF?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Russia has been welcoming</u></strong> Chinese investments since 2015; more now than ever due to the economic pressures caused by the war in Ukraine.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>Trans-Siberian Railway</u></strong> has further helped Russia and China in advancing trade ties.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>countries share a 4000-km-long border</u></strong>, which enables them to tap into each other’s resources with some infrastructural assistance.</li>
<li>China is also looking to develop its <strong><u>Heilongjiang Province</u></strong> which connects with the RFE.</li>
<li>Both nations have invested in a fund to develop <strong><u>connectivity between the cities of</u></strong><u> <strong>Blagoveshchensk and Heihe</strong></u>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>India and Russia’s Far East</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India seeks to expand its influence in the RFE.</li>
<li>In 2019, India also offered a <strong><u>$1 billion line of credit</u></strong> to develop infrastructure in the region.</li>
<li>During the forum, PM Modi expressed the country’s readiness in expanding trade, connectivity and investments in Russia.</li>
<li>India is keen to deepen its cooperation in energy, pharmaceuticals, maritime connectivity, healthcare, tourism, the diamond industry and the Arctic.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Strategic significance of EEF for Russia</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gateway to Asia:</strong> The RFE is geographically placed at a strategic location; acting as a gateway into Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Negating the Ukrainian war impact:</strong> The Ukraine war is a worrying issue as it affects the economic growth of the country.</li>
<li><strong>Surviving sanctions:</strong> Although, the EEF is an annual gathering, the forum comes at an opportune time for Russia who is dealing with the impact of the sanctions.</li>
<li><strong>Supply chain resilience:</strong> The IPEF will also play a key role in building resilient supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Will India be able to strike a balance between the EEF and IPEF?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Both are incomparable:</strong> The US-led <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/indo-pacific-economic-framework-for-prosperity-ipef/">Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)</a> and the EEF are incomparable based on its geographic coverage and the partnership with the host-countries.</li>
<li><strong>India values both:</strong> India has not shied away from investing in the Russia-initiated EEF despite the current international conditions.</li>
<li><strong>India is firm for its purpose:</strong> At the same time, India has given its confirmation and acceptance to three of the four pillars in the IPEF.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>India understands the benefits of being involved in the development in the RFE but it also perceives the IPEF as a vital platform to strengthen its presence in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
<li>India’s participation in the forum will help in disengaging from supply chains that are dependent on China and will also make it a part of the global supply chain network.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Manufacturing can create higher productivity jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is service sector?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The service sector, also known as the tertiary sector, is <strong>the third tier in the three-sector economy</strong>. Instead of product production, this sector produces services maintenance and repairs, training, or consulting. Examples of service sector jobs include housekeeping, tours, nursing, and teaching.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is called manufacturing sector?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing is the making of goods by hand or by machine that upon completion the business sells to a customer. Items used in manufacture may be raw materials or component parts of a larger product. The manufacturing usually happens on a large-scale production line of machinery and skilled labor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Services sector failed to create more jobs</strong>: So far, in services, we have certainly developed some advantage and we are doing rather well. Services’ share of the economy has gone up to over 50% of the GDP. However, this sector has not been able to create enough jobs in a commensurate manner. The result is that agriculture still continues to sustain nearly half of India’s workforce, which means that 15% of GDP is supporting some 45% of the workforce.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing can provide productive jobs</strong>: We need more productive job opportunities for the workforce to shift away from agriculture. We need to focus attention on the manufacturing sector because of the direct and indirect jobs that it can create.</li>
<li><strong>Empirical fact</strong>: It is an empirical fact that manufacturing of all productive sectors has the highest backward and forward linkages.</li>
<li><strong>Significant potential:</strong> So, all together, there is significant potential for the manufacturing sector to create higher productivity jobs for people stuck in agricultural activities. That is the future for India.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Manufacturing" class="alignnone wp-image-636757" height="400" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sectors-of-Indian-Economy-backup-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sectors-of-Indian-Economy-backup-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sectors-of-Indian-Economy-backup-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sectors-of-Indian-Economy-backup-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sectors-of-Indian-Economy-backup-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sectors-of-Indian-Economy-backup.jpg 1280w" width="710"/>What is<a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/pli-scheme-will-help-india-nurture-manufacturing-giants/"> PLI</a> Scheme?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As the name suggests, the scheme provides incentives to companies for enhancing their domestic manufacturing apart from focusing on reducing import bills and improving the cost competitiveness of local goods.</li>
<li>PLI scheme offers incentives on incremental sales for products manufactured in India.</li>
<li>The scheme for respective sectors has to be implemented by the concerned ministries and departments.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Criteria laid for the scheme</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Eligibility criteria for businesses under the PLI scheme vary based on the sector approved under the scheme.</li>
<li>For instance, the eligibility for telecom units is subject to the achievement of a minimum threshold of cumulative incremental investment and incremental sales of manufactured goods.</li>
<li>The minimum investment threshold for MSME is Rs 10 crore and Rs 100 crores for others.</li>
<li>Under food processing, SMEs and others must hold over 50 per cent of the stock of their subsidiaries, if any.</li>
<li>On the other hand, for businesses under pharmaceuticals, the project has to be a green-field project while the net worth of the company should not be less than 30 per cent of the total committed investment.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are the incentives offered?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An incentive of 4-6 per cent was offered last year on mobile and electronic components manufacturers such as resistors, transistors, diodes, etc.</li>
<li>Similarly, 10 percent incentives were offered for six years (FY22-27) of the scheme for the food processing industry.</li>
<li>For white goods too, the incentive of 4-6 per cent on incremental sales of goods manufactured in India for a period of five years was offered to companies engaged in the manufacturing of air conditioners and LED lights.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Benefits of PLI</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The scheme has a direct employment generation potential of over 2,00,000 jobs over 5 years.</li>
<li>It would lead to large scale electronics manufacturing in the country and open tremendous employment opportunities. Indirect employment will be about 3 times of direct employment as per industry estimates.</li>
<li>Thus, the total employment potential of the scheme is approximately 8,00,000.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In order to integrate India as a pivotal part of this modern economy, there is a strong need to step up our manufacturing capabilities.</li>
</ul>
