<ul>
<li>The outline of an essential global pandemic treaty.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Purpose of the treaty</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A pandemic treaty under the umbrella of the World Health Organization would build coherence and avoid fragmentation of response.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Severity of this pandemic demands such treaty</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 would count as being among some of the most severe pandemics the world has seen in the last 100 years. An estimated <strong>18 million</strong> people may have died from COVID-19, according various credible estimates, a scale of loss not seen since the Second World War.</li>
<li>Further, with over <strong>120 million</strong> people pushed into extreme poverty, and a massive global recession, no single government or institution has been able to address this emergency singlehandedly.</li>
<li>This has given us a larger perspective of how nobody is safe until everybody is safe.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Catchy line for value addition</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Nobody is safe until everybody is safe</em></p></blockquote>
<h4><strong><img alt="pandemic treaty" class="alignnone wp-image-633179" height="237" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/charles_michel-1024x569-1-300x167.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/charles_michel-1024x569-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/charles_michel-1024x569-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/charles_michel-1024x569-1.jpg 1024w" width="426"/>There is widespread inequity in healthcare </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross inequity in distribution: </strong>Health-care systems have been stretched beyond their capacity and gross health inequity has been observed in the distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics across the world.</li>
<li><strong>Irreversible consequences</strong>: While high-income economies are still recovering from the aftereffects, the socioeconomic consequences of the novel coronavirus pandemic are irreversible in low and low middle-income countries.</li>
<li><strong>The monopolies</strong>: Held by pharma majors such as Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna created at least nine new billionaires since the beginning of the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/yojana-archive-the-pandemic-global-synergy/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> and made over $1,000 a second in profits, even as fewer of their vaccines reached people in low-income countries.</li>
<li><strong>Skewed distribution</strong>: As of March 2022, only 3% of people in low-income countries had been vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to 60.18% in high-income countries. The international target to vaccinate 70% of the world’s population against COVID-19 by mid-2022 was missed because poorer countries were at the “back of the queue” when vaccines were rolled out.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic response</strong>: India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and reinstating global equity by leveraging its own potential has set an example to legislators worldwide.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/vaccine-diplomacy-that-needs-specific-clarifications/">Vaccine diplomacy</a>:</strong> India produces nearly 60% of the world’s vaccines and is said to account for 60%-80% of the United Nations’ annual vaccine procurement “vaccine diplomacy” or “vaccine maitri” with a commitment against health inequity.</li>
<li><strong>We lead by example</strong>: India was unfettered in its resolve to continue the shipment of vaccines and other diagnostics even when it was experiencing a vaccine shortage for domestic use. There was only a brief period of weeks during the peak of the second wave in India when the vaccine mission was halted.</li>
<li><strong>A classic example of global cooperation:</strong> As of 2021, India shipped 594.35 lakh doses of ‘Made-in-India’ COVID-19 vaccines to 72 countries a classic example of global cooperation. Among these, 81.25 lakh doses were gifts, 339.67 lakh doses were commercially distributed and 173.43 lakh doses were delivered via the Covax programme under the aegis of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why the treaty is needed for?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data sharing</strong>: A treaty should cover crucial aspects such as data sharing and genome sequencing of emerging viruses.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid response mechanism</strong>: It should formally commit governments and parliaments to implement an early warning system and a properly funded rapid response mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Health investments</strong>: Further, it should mobilise nation states to agree on a set of common metrics that are related to health investments and a return on those investments. These investments should aim to reduce the public-private sector gap.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A global pandemic treaty will not only reduce socioeconomic inequalities across nation states but also enhance a global pandemic preparedness for future health emergencies. India must take the lead in this.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>English should be taught effectively not as the medium, but as a second language</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-national-education-policy-2020-higher-education-and-regional-languages/"><strong>What is the debate?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Over the years, there has been a raging debate over the need for children to have their mother tongue as the medium of instruction in schools.</li>
<li>While educationists have emphasised the importance of learning in the mother tongue to enhance a child’s learning and overcome glaring inequities, there has been an equally steady demand for English-medium schools in several States.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="language" class="alignnone wp-image-633189" height="502" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-3-212x300.png" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-3-212x300.png 212w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-3.png 361w" width="355"/>Historic context to this debate </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orientalist: </strong>Orientalists were the group of people who wanted to give education to Indian people in the Indian language. The emphasis was on the knowledge of the East. They wanted Indians to learn about Indian philosophy, science, and literature. In the Initial stage, company officials favoured oriental learning<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anglicist: </strong>Anglicists were those people who supported the teaching of modern western education to Indian people in the English language. People who favoured Anglicists were Thomas Babington, Macaulay, James’s mill, Charles wood, Charles Trevelyan, and Elphinstone. The Anglicists were supported by the most advanced Indians like Raja Ram Mohan Roy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="language" class="alignnone wp-image-633190" height="233" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SCH_7123-300x167.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SCH_7123-300x167.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SCH_7123-768x428.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SCH_7123.jpg 821w" width="419"/>Why mother tongue is important? </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suitability to child: </strong>There is an almost-complete consensus among educationists, linguistic experts and psychologists that the mother tongue, or the language of the region where the child lives, is the only appropriate language of learning for the child.</li>
<li><strong>Incomprehension</strong>: A child can be taught any number of languages, particularly later in life, but the medium of learning should be the mother tongue. As a number of classrooms today are stalked by the curse of incomprehension.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure of English language</strong>: There are a growing number of schools, mostly private, that teach in English. Government schools too in States like Tamil Nadu, unable to bear the pressure from parents and to stop students from migrating to private schools, are switching to English medium.</li>
<li><strong>Development in every way: </strong>The mother tongue, home language or the first language educationally means the language which the child is using to connect to the world, to people, to nature, to the environment, and to make sense of everything that’s going on. This is the language which helps the child to build, grow and develop in every way.</li>
<li><strong>Inability to learn:</strong> English medium education is a profound tragedy in Indian education today. Millions are languishing because of their inability to learn in English not English as a language but as a medium through which they acquire any knowledge of any subject.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why English Should Be the Medium of Instruction in Schools, Colleges?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity with The Rest of the World</strong>: To communicate and be on par with the world, the first language that stands common is English. With English, a student can remain on par with what is happening across the globe. Lack of English knowledge or alone mother tongue does not allow children to progress with the rest of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Technologies Can Be Used Only With English Instruction</strong>: Most of the modern technologies are invented, reinvented and modernized in foreign shores. The inventors keep the English language for the instruction manual of the technological gadget so that the gadget can be used worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Education Emphasizes on The English language</strong>: The main focus of teaching medium in higher secondary as well as in graduation and post-graduation colleges in India. There is no doubt that lecturers also teach in Hindi or other regional languages. However, question design comes in both English and regional language. But most of the classes are taught in English.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How multilingual approach helps</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, multilingualism gives equal status to all languages and there’s enough work, history and research on this.</li>
<li>Second, children come from different backgrounds, and in some cases, they are first-generation learners with not much support at home.</li>
<li>The multilingual approach thus, is much more flexible, closer to the child, and inclusive. It is democratic, and it accepts that the teacher is not coming from a place of authority and is only correcting spellings and pronunciations<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>This myth must be broken that our education system is class and caste neutral. A powerful political movement will have to take place to make the language of learning a choice that is made democratically.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Should the mother tongue or English be the medium of instruction? Critically explain.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>India ranks 132 out of 191 countries in the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-three-decades-of-human-development-index-hdi/">Human Development Index (HDI)</a> 2021, after registering a decline in its score over two consecutive years for the first time in three decades.</p>
<h4>What is Human Development Index (HDI)?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The HDI combines indicators of life expectancy, education or access to knowledge and income or standard of living, and captures the level and changes to the quality of life.</li>
<li>The index initially launched as an alternative measure to the gross domestic product, is the making of two acclaimed economists from Pakistan and India, namely Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen.</li>
<li>It stresses the centrality of human deve­lop­ment in the growth process and was first rolled out by the United Nations Development Programme in 1990.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dimensions of the Human Development Index – HDI</h4>
<ul>
<li>The idea that progress should be conceived as a process of enlarging people’s choices and enhancing their capabilities is the central premise of the HDI.</li>
<li>Since its launch, the HDI has been an important marker of attempts to broaden measures of progress.</li>
<li>The HDI considers three main dimensions to evaluate the development of a country:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Long and healthy life</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Standard of living</li>
</ol>
<h4>Limitations of HDI</h4>
<p>HDR has been always disputable and has caught the public-eye, whenever it was published. It has many reasons.</p>
<p>One of them is that the concept of human development is much deeper and richer than what can be caught in any index or set of indicators. Another argument is that its concept has not changed since 1990 when it was also defined in the first.</p>
<p><strong>(1) An incomplete indicator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Human development is incomplete without human freedom and that while the need for qualities judgement is clear; there is no simple quantitative measure available yet to capture the many aspects of human freedom.</li>
<li>HDI also does not specifically reflect quality of life factors, such as empowerment movements or overall feelings of security or happiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Limited idea of development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HDI is not reflecting the human development idea accurately.</li>
<li>It is an index restricted to the socio-economic sphere of life<strong>; </strong>the political and civil spheres are in the most part kept separate.</li>
<li>Hence there is a sub-estimation of inequality among countries, which means that this dimension is not being taken into consideration appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) A vague concept</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Concerning data quality and the exact construction of the index HDI is conceptually weak and empirically unsound.</li>
<li>This strong critic comes from the idea that both components of HDI are problematic. The GNP in developing countries suffers from incomplete coverage, measurement errors and biases.</li>
<li>The definition and measurement of literacy are different among countries and also, this data has not been available since 1970 in a significant number of countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Data quality issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HDI, as a combination of only four relatively simple indicators, doesn’t only raise a questions what other indicators should be included, but also how to ensure quality and comparable input data.</li>
<li>It is logical that the UNDP try to collect their data from international organizations concentrating in collecting data in specific fields.</li>
<li>Quality and trustworthiness of those data is disputable, especially when we get the information from UN non-democratic members, as for example Cuba or China.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(5) A tool for mere comparison</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of HDI was set up mainly for relative comparison of countries in one particular time.</li>
<li>HDI is much better when distinguishing between countries with low and middle human development, instead of countries at the top of the ranking.</li>
<li>Therefore, the original notion was not to set up an absolute ranking, but let’s quite free hands in comparison of the results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(6) Development has to be greener</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The human development approach has not adequately incorporated environmental conditions which may threaten long-term achievements on human development. The most pervasive failure was on environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>However, for the first time in 2020, the UNDP introduced a new metric to reflect the impact caused by each country’s per-capita carbon emissions and its material footprint.</li>
<li>This is Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI or PHDI. It measured the amount of fossil fuels, metals and other resources used to make the goods and services it consumes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(7) Wealth can never equate welfare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher national wealth does not indicate welfare. GNI may not necessarily increase economic welfare; it depends on how it is spent.</li>
<li>For example, if a country spends more on military spending – this is reflected in higher GNI, but welfare could actually be lower.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Significance of HDI</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is one of the few multidimensional indices as it includes indicators such as literacy rate, enrollment ratio, life expectancy rate, infant mortality rate, etc.</li>
<li>It acts as a true yardstick to measure development in real sense.</li>
<li>Unlike per capital income, which only indicates that a rise in per capital income implies economic development; HDI considers many other vital social indicators and helps in measuring a nation’s well-being.</li>
<li>It helps as a differentiating factor to distinguish and classify different nations on the basis of their HDI ranks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>Both sustainable development and poverty eradication are both long-term and urgent endeavours, requiring not only the gradual and substantial redirection of country policies but a rapid response to pressing problems.</li>
<li>Ideally, sustainable development could provide an overarching framework within which all sub-goals (eg poverty eradication, social equality, ecosystem maintenance, climate compatibility) are framed.</li>
<li>It is not a subset of development; it is development (in a modern world of resource limits).</li>
<li>Environmental issues are not one factor among many but the meta-context within which poverty and other goals are sought.</li>
<li>Investing more in public research could lead to technological solutions to poverty and sustainability problems becoming more rapidly and openly available.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Government of India is ready to incorporate the Yehzabo, the Naga Constitution, into the Indian Constitution and has agreed for a civil and cultural flag for the Nagas.</p>
<h4>Who are the Naga?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The term Naga was created by the British for administrative convenience to refer to a group of tribes with similar origins but distinct cultures, dialects, and customs.</li>
<li>The Naga tribes are accumulated in Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Myanmar.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-naga-peace-talks/">Naga separatists</a> group has timely reiterated that the ‘Naga National flag’ and ‘Yehzabo’ (Constitution) are non-negotiable issues.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Has the GoI agreed to this?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Centre is clear that <strong><u>there cannot be two Constitutions</u></strong> and two flags in the country.</li>
<li>The Yehzabo will be incorporated into the Indian Constitution by presenting a Bill in Parliament.</li>
<li>As far as flag is concerned, it will only be used for civil and cultural functions, but not in any government function.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why did the Naga insurgency begin?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Residing in the Naga Hills of Assam during the advent of the British and the annexation of Assam in 1820, the Nagas did not consider themselves a part of British India.</li>
<li>The British adopted a way of governance over the Nagas that involved keeping in place their traditional ways of life, customs, and laws while putting British administrators at the top.</li>
<li>At the time of the withdrawal of the British, insecurity grew among the Naga tribes about the future of their cultural autonomy after India’s independence.</li>
<li>This was accompanied by the fear of the entry of “plains people” or “outsiders” into their territory.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Do you know?</strong></p>
<p>In a memorandum to the <strong><em>Simon Commission in 1929</em></strong>, representatives of Naga tribes demanded that Nagas be left free after Independence and not be included in the Indian Union.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Collective actions of the Nagas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Above mentioned factors gave rise to the <strong>formation of the Naga Hills District Tribal Council</strong> in 1945, which was renamed the Naga National Council (NNC) in 1946.</li>
<li>Amid uncertainties over the post-independence future of the Nagas, a section of the NNC, led by Naga leader A.Z. Phizo <strong>declared the independence</strong> of the Nagas on August 14, 1947.</li>
<li>The <strong>underground insurgency</strong> began in the early 1950s when Mr. Phizo founded the Naga Federal Government (NFG) and its armed wing, the Naga Federal Army (NFA).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Outcome of the then insurgency</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Central Government sent the <strong>armed forces into Naga areas</strong> to curb the insurgency.</li>
<li>It imposed the contentious <strong>Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA)</strong> which is still in place in parts of Nagaland.</li>
<li>The Nagas, led by Mr. Phizo, demanding an independent state outside of India, <strong>boycotted the 1952 and 1957 general elections</strong> and armed clashes grew.</li>
<li>Unlike other groups in the north east which were accepting some form of autonomy under the Constitution, Nagas rejected this in <strong>favour of sovereignty</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Negotiations with the govt</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some leaders among the NNC formed their own group to hold discussions with the government, leading to the formation of the State of Nagaland in 1963.</li>
<li>This, however, did not satisfy many in the NNC and NFG, who, following years of negotiations with the government, eventually signed the Shillong Accord of 1975, agreeing to surrender arms and accept the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When did the NSCN come into the picture?</h4>
<ul>
<li>This signing of the Shillong Accord was <strong>not agreeable with many top leaders</strong> of the NNC and those operating from Myanmar.</li>
<li>A/c to them, the agreement <strong>did not address the issue of Naga sovereignty and</strong> coerced them to accept the Constitution.</li>
<li>Three NNC <strong>rebel leaders, formed the National Socialist Council Of Nagaland (NSCN)</strong> to continue the armed movement for ‘independence’.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Again split in NSCN</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1988, after years of infighting and violent clashes along tribal lines and over the main cause of the movement, the NSCN split into two factions.</li>
<li>One, led by Mr. Muiwah and Swu called the NSCN-IM and the other, led by Mr. Khaplang called the NSCN-K.</li>
<li>The NSCN-IM demanded and continues to <strong>demand for ‘Greater Nagaland’ or Nagalim.</strong></li>
<li>It wants to <strong>extend Nagaland’s borders</strong> by including Naga-dominated areas in the neighbouring States of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.</li>
<li>The NSCN-IM has now grown to become the <strong><u>most powerful insurgent group</u></strong>, also playing a role in the creation of smaller groups in other States.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where do the peace talks stand now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 1997, the Government of India got the NSCN-IM to sign a ceasefire agreement to begin the holding of talks with the aim of signing a Naga Peace Accord.</li>
<li>After this ceasefire, there have been over a hundred rounds of talks spanning over 24 years between the Centre and the insurgent group, while a <strong>solution is still awaited</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues of contention</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independence celebration:</strong> Nagas across Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh celebrate August 14 as Independence Day. According to Naga historians, Gandhi agreed that the Nagas would celebrate their independence a day ahead of India, on August 14, 1947.</li>
<li><strong>Naga flag:</strong> In the Naga narrative, passed down generations by word of mouth, the Naga flag was not designed by a mortal but is of divine origin.</li>
<li><strong>Secessionist tendencies: </strong>A large section of the Nagas still holds dear the idea of the Naga identity and their tribal roots.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way ahead</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Naga struggle claimed thousands of lives over decades and devastated countless homes, all over the idea of a sovereign Naga nation.</li>
<li>If the NSCN (I-M) accedes to economic and political packages alone, without a separate flag and constitution, it remains to be seen whether it will be seen as a solution, or as a defeat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prime Minister Modi has tweeted his condolences and hoped for an early restoration of normalcy in flood devastated Pakistan.</p>
<h4>Why in news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The statement by the PM last month came as a <strong><u>surprise to many</u></strong>.</li>
<li>This is on the grounds of <strong><u>steady deterioration of ties</u></strong> over the last eight years since Modi came to power.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PM Modi and Pakistan</h4>
<p><strong>(A) Early failure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PM Modi had famously begun his tenure with an invitation to Pakistan’s then PM Nawaz Sharif for the swearing-in ceremony in May 2014.</li>
<li>Sharif had come to India, along with the leaders of other SAARC nations.</li>
<li>This gesture promised a <strong><u>new beginning for the bilateral relationship</u></strong> that had suffered a severe setback after the <strong><u>26/11 terrorist attacks</u></strong> in Mumbai in 2008.</li>
<li>However, a string of incidents followed, the terrorist attacks in <strong><u>Pathankot and Uri</u></strong> — impacted the relationship negatively, and New Delhi made it clear that “<strong><u>talks and terror can’t go together</u></strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(B) India strengthens resolute</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ties have been hit further over the last few years, especially after the <strong><u>Pulwama terror attack</u></strong> in February 2019, and the <strong><u>abrogation of Article 370</u></strong> in August that year.</li>
<li>That led to the <strong><u>downsizing of the High Commissions</u></strong> in both capitals; there are n<strong><u>o full-time High Commissioners</u></strong> in either country now.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Change of PM in Pak</h4>
<ul>
<li>After the ouster of Imran Khan, and the coming to power of the <strong><u>new coalition government</u></strong> led by PM Shehbaz Sharif, some positive noises have emanated from Islamabad.</li>
<li>India however reiterated the desired peace and stability in a region free of terrorism.</li>
<li>New Pak PM criticized his predecessor, Imran Khan, for not making “serious and diplomatic efforts” when India abrogated Article 370 in August 2019.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Responses to disasters</h4>
<p>In the past, when natural disasters struck India and Pakistan, the two countries at times reached out to each other with offers of help.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bhuj earthquake:</strong> For example, in January-February 2001, after the earthquake hit Bhuj in Gujarat, Pakistan had reached out with help, and had sent tents and blankets for the survivors.</li>
<li><strong>2005 earthquake:</strong> A powerful earthquake struck both India and Pakistan, India sent aircraft with relief supplies to Pakistan and pledged $ 25 million through the United Nations to support Pakistan’s relief efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2010, when a “superflood” — the worst in recent decades until the deluge of 2022 — hit Pakistan, India offered $ 5 million in help, but Islamabad declined to accept it.</p>
<h4>The case for help now</h4>
<ul>
<li>Though there has not been much follow-up activity, the PM Modi’s outreach by way of a message created a potential opening for “<strong><u>disaster diplomacy</u></strong>”.</li>
<li>Pakistan’s Finance Minister said that the government can consider importing vegetables and other edible items from India following the destruction of standing crops due to the floods.</li>
<li>Prices of vegetables and fruit have gone through the roof as supplies from Balochistan, Sindh, and south Punjab especially, have been badly affected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why should India respond?</h4>
<ul>
<li>For the Indian government, the case for extending humanitarian help ties in well with its desire to project itself as the “<strong><u>first responder</u></strong>” in times of disaster and crisis in the neighbourhood.</li>
<li>In recent months and years, India has extended its hand of help and cooperation to the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, and Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Trucks filled with Indian grain have travelled to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan via Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is Pakistan’s position?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pakistan’s establishment (none other but Pak Army) has <strong><u>discussed the possibility</u></strong> of getting food grains through international organisations, who want to send relief material from India.</li>
<li>The help from India can be at the <strong><u>micro and short-term level</u></strong>: food, fuel, tents, medicines, and emergency essential supplies.</li>
<li>At the <strong><u>macro and medium-to-long-term</u></strong>, it could involve help in the reconstruction of damaged homes and properties, and the archaeological site of <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/floods-mohenjo-daro-world-heritage-tag/">Mohenjo Daro</a>, part of the cultural heritage of both countries.</li>
<li>India’s <strong><u>healthcare</u></strong> can be of help in the post-floods scenario — dengue is already on the rise, and diseases such as typhoid are expected to spike sharply.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Issues in re-engagement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some in the Indian establishment believe that the government’s <strong><u>stated policy</u></strong> of talks and terror can’t go together, and the <strong><u>extending of help to Pakistan are at odds with each other</u></strong>.</li>
<li>For New Delhi, the decision is as much about <strong><u>projecting power as a global responder</u></strong> as with managing the ruling party’s domestic political base.</li>
</ul>

<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>LAC</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>India-China border issues</p></div></div><p><img alt="lac" class="alignnone wp-image-633461" height="308" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/lac-300x185.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/lac-300x185.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/lac.jpg 667w" width="499"/></p>
<p>India and China have announced that their Armies have begun to disengage from Patrolling Point-15 in the Gogra-Hot springs area at LAC.</p>
<h4>What is LAC- the Line of Actual Control?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The LAC is the demarcation that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory.</li>
<li>India considers the LAC to be <strong><u>3,488 km long</u></strong>, while the Chinese consider it to be only around 2,000 km.</li>
<li>It is divided into three sectors: the eastern sector which spans Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, the middle sector in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, and the western sector in Ladakh.</li>
<li>The LAC is <strong><u>only a concept</u></strong> – it is <strong><u>not agreed upon by the two countries</u></strong>, <strong><u>neither delineated on a map nor demarcated on the ground.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the disagreement?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The alignment of the LAC in the eastern sector is along the 1914 McMahon Line, and there are minor disputes about the positions on the ground as per the principle of the high Himalayan watershed.</li>
<li>The major disagreements are in the western sector where the LAC emerged from two letters written by Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai to PM Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959, after he had first mentioned such a ‘line’ in 1956.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When did India accept the LAC?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The LAC was discussed during Chinese Premier Li Peng’s <strong><u>1991</u></strong> visit to India, where <strong><u>PM P V Narasimha Rao</u></strong> and Li reached an understanding to maintain peace and tranquillity at the LAC.</li>
<li>India formally accepted the concept of the LAC when Rao paid a return visit to Beijing in 1993 and the two sides signed the <strong><u>Agreement to Maintain Peace and Tranquillity at the LAC.</u></strong></li>
<li>The reference to the LAC was unqualified to make it clear that it was not referring to the LAC of 1959 or 1962 but to the <strong><u>‘LAC’ at the time when the agreement was signed</u></strong>.</li>
<li>To reconcile the differences about some areas, the two countries agreed that the Joint Working Group on the border issue would take up the task of clarifying the alignment of the LAC.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How was the disengagement carried on?</h4>
<ul>
<li>As per the understanding reached earlier on disengagement, a <strong><u>buffer zone is to be created</u></strong> at the friction points.</li>
<li>Once troops are withdrawn by both sides, <strong><u>new patrolling norms</u></strong> are to be worked out after complete disengagement and de-escalation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why sudden disengagement?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The move comes <strong><u>ahead of the </u></strong><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/shanghai-cooperation-organisation-sco/"><strong>Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)</strong></a><strong><u> summit</u></strong> in Uzbekistan next week.</li>
<li>However, neither side has, so far, confirmed if the two leaders would hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of the summit.</li>
<li>The leaders have not spoken to each other since a November 2019 meeting during the BRICS Summit in Brasilia and the beginning of the stand-off in April 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Significance of the disengagement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since the <strong><u>stand-off began in May 2020</u></strong>, the two sides have so far held 16 rounds of talks.</li>
<li>Earlier, disengagement was undertaken from both sides of Pangong Tso in February 2021, and from PP-17 in the Gogra-Hot springs area in August, in addition to Galwan in 2020 after the violent clash.</li>
<li>The <strong><u>friction points that remain now are Demchok and Depsang</u></strong>, which China has constantly refused to accept, maintaining that they are not a part of the current stand-off.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What was the dispute over LAC?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In what was the worst clash between the two countries in over 40 years, the Galwan incident reverberated around the world.</li>
<li>The casualties in the clash were the first in the disputed Sino-Indian border since 1975.</li>
<li>The Galwan episode led to a rapid build-up of forces on both sides of the Line of Actual Control.</li>
<li>This incident is being seen as major punctuation in the bilateral relations between India and China and what does the future hold for both neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why did India change its stance on the Line of Actual Control?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Indian and Chinese patrols were coming in more frequent contact during the mid-1980s.</li>
<li>This was after the government formed a China Study Group in 1976 which revised the patrolling limits, rules of engagement and pattern of Indian presence along the border.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is the LAC also the claim line for both countries?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not for India. <strong><u>India’s claim line</u></strong> is the line seen in the official boundary marked on the maps as released by the Survey of India, <strong><u>including both Aksai Chin and Gilgit-Baltistan</u></strong>.</li>
<li>In China’s case, it corresponds mostly to its claim line, but in the eastern sector, it claims entire Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet.</li>
<li>However, the claim lines come into question when a discussion on the final international boundaries takes place, and not when the conversation is about a working border, say the LAC.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why are these claim lines controversial in Ladakh?</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the Shimla Agreement on the McMahon Line was signed by British India, Aksai Chin in Ladakh province of the princely state of <strong><u>J&amp;K was not part of British India</u></strong>, although it was a part of the British Empire.</li>
<li>Thus, the eastern boundary was well defined in 1914 but in the west in Ladakh, it was not.</li>
<li>India, in July 1948, had two maps: one had <strong><u>no boundary shown in the western sector</u></strong>, only a partial colour wash; the second one extended the colour wash in yellow to the entire state of J&amp;K, but mentioned “boundary undefined”.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>The impasse in India-China relations <strong><u>CANNOT be overcome by more talks</u></strong> through diplomatic and military channels, and possibly require the intervention of the top leadership of both countries.</li>
<li>Therefore, as Dr. Jaishankar put it, the management of the fissures within Asia will require <strong><u>adherence to established laws, norms, and rules.</u></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A horrific car accident killed Cyrus Mistry and Jehangir Pandole. This tragedy got plenty of people thinking about road safety measures. Sadly, neither Mistry nor Pandole was wearing their rear-seat safety belts this highlights importance of following road safety norms.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What’s the meaning of road safety?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Road safety means methods and measures aimed at reducing the likelihood or the risk of persons using the road network getting involved in a collision or an incident that may cause property damages, serious injuries and/or death.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is road safety education?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The aim of education, training and encouragement in Road Safety is to educate all road users in the proper and safe use of roads in order to change user attitudes and behaviour and to stimulate an awareness of the need for improvement in road safety.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What affects road safety?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Several factors most notably speed, traffic density, flow, congestion, demographics (namely age gender and deprivation), driving behaviour (involving alcohol consumption, helmet or seat belt usage) and land use, such as residential or economic zones, were found to have mixed effects on road safety.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="Road Safety" class="alignnone wp-image-634190" height="296" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/166385-road-safety-website-graphic-300x200.png" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/166385-road-safety-website-graphic-300x200.png 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/166385-road-safety-website-graphic.png 750w" width="444"/>What are examples of road safety?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Pedestrian crossing warning;</li>
<li>Left turn driver assistance; and</li>
<li>Approaching emergency vehicle warning.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Road Accidents in India A lookover</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In spite of several years of policymaking to improve road safety, India remains among the worst-performing countries in this area.</li>
<li>Total 1,47,913 lives lost to road traffic accidents in 2017 as per Ministry of Road Transport and Highways statistics.</li>
<li>The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figure for the same year is 1,50,093 road accident deaths.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Do you know?</strong></p>
<p>The ‘golden hour’ has been defined as ‘the time period lasting one hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing prompt medical care.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Causes of Road Accidents in India</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub-standard roads</strong>: The life of roads is not good due to the substandard raw materials and potholes accidents caused.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic:</strong> The increasing traffic on roads and conditions of roads are not proportionate to each other.</li>
<li><strong>Use of mobile phone</strong>: Most of the people are on call while driving thus they drive recklessly and accidents happen as most of the Indians now have mobile phones.</li>
<li><strong>Drunk Driving</strong>: Drinking makes people lose the ability to focus and function properly. This makes it dangerous for the driver to operate the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Dis-obedience for traffic rules</strong>: Indian drivers are quick to learn to drive but they don’t learn traffic rules and the purpose of such rules.</li>
<li><strong>Malpractices:</strong> Malpractices such as over-speeding, triple riding, underage driving, etc are reducing the safety of road users.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation drawbacks</strong>: Police are supposed to execute the rules but, it may be a lack of workforce or lack of intention, they also fail to execute.</li>
<li><strong>Corrupt practices</strong>: Mostly police use the rules to mint money either officially by Chalan or in person.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key data for value addition</strong></p>
<p>Despite being home to only 1% of the world’s vehicles, India shoulders 11% of the global road crash fatality burden.</p></blockquote>

Stricter provisions are being proposed in respect of offences like juvenile driving, drunken driving, driving without licence, dangerous driving, over-speeding, overloading etc. Stricter provisions for helmets have been introduced along with provisions for electronic detection of violations.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Fitness:</strong> Automated fitness testing for vehicles has been made mandatory. This would reduce corruption in the transport department while improving the road worthiness of the vehicle. Penalty has been provided for deliberate violation of safety/environmental regulations as well as for body builders and spare part suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Recall of Vehicles:</strong> The Act allows the central government to order for recall of motor vehicles if a defect in the vehicle may cause damage to the environment, or the driver, or other road users.</li>
<li><strong>Road Safety Board:</strong> A National Road Safety Board, to be created by the central government through a notification to advise the central and state governments on all aspects of road safety and traffic management. This would include standards of motor vehicles, registration and licensing of vehicles, standards for road safety, and promotion of new vehicle technology.</li>
<li><strong>Protection of Good Samaritan</strong>: The Act lays down the guidelines and provides rules to prevent harassment of Good Samaritan to encourage people to help road accident victims.</li>
<li><strong>Cashless Treatment during Golden Hour</strong>: The Act provides for a scheme for cashless treatment of road accident victims during golden hour.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Value addition for good marks</strong></h4>
<p>The 4 ‘E’ Approach</p>
<ul>
<li>The Government of India put forth Engineering, Economy, Enforcement and Education as the fundamental areas to focus on in order to ensure road safety.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Road safety education from the primary level</strong>: Those already using our roads and driving or riding on it could have formed bad habits that are difficult to change or undo. So it’s important that we catch them young and start educating children on road safety and correct behaviour on the road.</li>
<li><strong>Better first aid and paramedic care:</strong> In most cases, the public and police are the first ones to reach the site of an accident. But sadly, neither has any first aid training and the police don’t even have even simple things like a first aid box or stretcher. This initial trauma care has to improve.</li>
<li><strong>Stricter criteria for driving licenses</strong>: Fortunately, the government has recognized the need for this, and getting a driving license is no longer as easy as before. Lots of the process has been digitalized and made more stringent. But it’s still far from perfect and lots more needs to be done</li>
<li><strong>Better road design, maintenance, and signage:</strong> Many of our roads are poorly designed with badly placed junctions, acute corners, uneven gradients, sudden speed-breakers, etc. And this is made worse by poor road maintenance and many accidents occur because a driver suddenly swerves to avoid a pothole.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy crackdown against non-compliance: </strong>This is one of the leading causes of road accidents in India and while we do have strict laws, the enforcement, particularly on our highways is quite lax. Consumption of drugs by truck drivers while driving is rampant, and this needs to stop completely.</li>
<li><strong>Stricter enforcement of traffic rules:</strong> The Amended Motor Vehicles Act has higher penalties and punishment to deter people from committing traffic offenses and driving rashly. It’s high time we enforced our traffic rules and imposed discipline while driving and using the road.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging better road behaviour:</strong> The people should motivate themselves to behave in a better manner on the road. The campaigns such as “Be the Better Guy”, need to be applauded, encouraged and expanded.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. In spite of several years of policymaking to improve road safety, India remains among the worst-performing countries in this area. Critically analyse.</strong></p></blockquote>

Context </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bengaluru floods are alarming us to go for robust disaster management strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is flood?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Causes of frequent urban floods</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Natural</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meteorological Factors:</strong>Heavy rainfall, cyclonic storms and thunderstorms causes water to flow quickly through paved urban areas and impound in low lying areas.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrological Factors</strong>: Overbank flow channel networks, occurrence of high tides impeding the drainage in coastal cities.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Climate change due to various anthropogenic events has led to extreme weather events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anthropological</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unplanned Urbanization:</strong>Unplanned Urbanization is the key cause of urban flooding. A major concern is blocking of natural drainage pathways through construction activity and encroachment on catchment areas, riverbeds and lakebeds.</li>
<li><strong>Destruction of lakes</strong>: A major issue in India cities. Lakes can store the excess water and regulate the flow of water. However, pollution of natural urban water bodies and converting them for development purposes has increased risk of floods.</li>
<li><strong>Unauthorised colonies and excess construction</strong>: Reduced infiltration due paving of surfaces which decreases ground absorption and increases the speed and amount of surface flow</li>
<li><strong>Poor Solid Waste Management System</strong>: Improper waste management system and clogging of storm-water drains because of silting, accumulation of non-biodegradable wastes and construction debris.</li>
<li><strong>Drainage System:</strong>Old and ill maintained drainage system is another factor making cities in India vulnerable to flooding.</li>
<li><strong>Irresponsible steps</strong>: Lack of attention to natural hydrological system and lack of flood control measures.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="floods" class="alignnone wp-image-634224" height="233" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20India-Flood-01-videoSixteenByNine3000-1980x1114.jpg 1980w" width="414"/>Impact of the devastation due to floods:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>On economy</strong>: Damage to infrastructure, roads and settlements, industrial production, basic supplies, post disaster rehabilitation difficulties etc.</li>
<li><strong>On human population and wildlife:</strong>Trauma, loss of life, injuries and disease outbreak, contamination of water etc.</li>
<li><strong>On environment:</strong>Loss of habitat, tree and forest cover, biodiversity loss and large scale greenery recovery failure.</li>
<li><strong>On transport and communication</strong>: Increased traffic congestion, disruption in rail services, disruption in communication- on telephone, internet cables causing massive public inconvenience.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Solutions for effective flood management</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved flood warning systems</strong>: effective flood warning systems can help take timely action during natural calamities and can save lives. Pre-planning can significantly reduce the effects of floods, giving people time to migrate to safer locations and stock up essentials.</li>
<li><strong>Building flood-resilient housing systems</strong>: concreting floors can be very useful during floods. Houses should be water proofed and electric sockets should be placed at higher levels up the walls to reduce the chances of shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Constructing buildings above flood levels</strong>: buildings should be constructed a metre above from the ground to prevent flood damage and evacuation during floods.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience to Climate change:</strong> drastic climate changes have increased the frequency of natural disasters in many parts of the world. Governments should bring about environment-friendly policy level changes and eliminate the ones hazardous to the environment to tackle the problem of global warming.</li>
<li><strong>Create wetlands and encourage reforestation:</strong> creating more and more wetlands can help soak up excessive moisture since wetlands act as sponges. Wooded areas can also slow down heavy water flow, minimizing the effects of floods. Reforesting upstream regions can significantly reduce the effects of flood damage.</li>
<li><strong>Improve soil conditions</strong>: improper soil management, animal hooves, and machinery can make soil compacted. As a result, instead of holding water in and absorbing moisture, the water runs off immediately. Properly drained soil can absorb large amounts of rainwater and can prevent it from flowing into the rivers.</li>
<li><strong>Installing flood barriers</strong>: these are flood gates designed to prevent the area behind the barrier from flooding. They can also be kept around buildings to keep floodwaters outside the boundary created.</li>
<li><strong>Development of GIS– Geographical Information System (GIS) based National Database</strong>: for disaster management. GIS is an effective tool for emergency responders to access information in terms of crucial parameters for disaster-affected areas.</li>
<li><strong>Developing a Federal flood management plan</strong>: with responsibilities of union and state clearly defined.</li>
<li><strong>Creation of 2nd flood commission</strong>: (Rashtriya Barh Aayog, created in 1976) to study the flood situation in India under rising challenges of climate change and propose a national-level flood resilience and management plan.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way forward</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resilience of people</strong>: The rapid transformation in rainfall characteristics and flooding patterns demand building people’s resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Reconsider projects</strong>: Construction projects that impede the movement of water and sediment across the floodplain must be reconsidered.</li>
<li><strong>Use of technology</strong>: At the same time, climate-imposed exigencies demand new paradigms of early-warning and response systems and securing livelihoods and economies.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>We can learn to live with nature, we can regulate human conduct through the state and we can strategically design where we build. We need to urgently rebuild our cities such that they have the sponginess to absorb and release water without causing so much misery and so much damage to the most vulnerable of our citizens.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. We need to urgently rebuild our cities such that they have the sponginess to absorb and release water. Discuss the statement in context of urban flood management strategy in India. </strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>People’s participation in the ‘TB-Mukt India’ campaign can help eliminate the disease by 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is TB?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A potentially serious infectious bacterial disease that mainly affects the lungs.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How TB is caused?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It’s spread when a person with active TB disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which contain TB bacteria.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What does TB do to humans?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It mainly affects the lungs, but it can affect any part of the body, including the tummy (abdomen), glands, bones and nervous system.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="TB" class="alignnone wp-image-634234" height="384" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eff22a35-8c59-4d6c-a8fe-bcbc4313755e-300x240.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eff22a35-8c59-4d6c-a8fe-bcbc4313755e-300x240.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eff22a35-8c59-4d6c-a8fe-bcbc4313755e-768x615.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/eff22a35-8c59-4d6c-a8fe-bcbc4313755e.jpg 800w" width="481"/>How long has the TB infected us?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>TB is as old as humanity itself, infecting us for at least 5,000 years. The infecting agent, a bacterium, was identified way back in 1882, by Robert Koch, signalling one of the landmark discoveries which laid the foundation of modern medicine</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Is TB painful?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>If TB affects your joints, you may develop pain that feels like arthritis. If TB affects your bladder, it may hurt to go to the bathroom and there may be blood in your urine. TB of the spine can cause back pain and leg paralysis. TB of the brain can cause headaches and nausea.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Can we get TB if vaccinated?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>BCG is a vaccine for TB. This vaccine is not widely used in the United States, but it is often given to infants and small children in other countries where TB is common. The BCG vaccine is not very good at protecting adults against TB. We can still get TB infection or TB disease even if you were vaccinated with BCG.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>When do TB symptoms start?</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><img alt="TB" class="alignnone wp-image-634235" height="341" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/one-of-many-tb-patient-hamad-darwish.jpg 1969w" width="512"/></strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TB disease usually develops slowly, and it may take several weeks before you notice you’re unwell. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected. Sometimes the infection does not cause any symptoms. This is known as latent TB.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Is TB curable permanently?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>TB can usually be completely cured by the person with TB taking a combination of TB drugs. The only time that TB may not be curable is when the person has drug resistant TB.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/story/tuberculosis-elimination-strategy/"><strong>What are drug-resistant tuberculosis?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a form of antimicrobial resistance that is difficult and costly to treat. It is caused by TB bacteria that are resistant to at least one of the first-line existing TB medications, resulting in fewer treatment options and increasing mortality rates.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Risk factors for TB include</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Poverty</li>
<li>HIV infection.</li>
<li>Being in jail or prison (where close contact can spread infection)</li>
<li>Substance abuse.</li>
<li>Taking medication that weakens the immune system.</li>
<li>Kidney disease and diabetes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>TB statistic for mains </strong></p>
<p>We are home to 1 in 4 of the world’s TB patients.</p>
<p>Over 2.5 million Indians are infected.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>Government initiatives </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nikshay Poshan Yojana</strong>: in which TB patients receive Rs 500 every month while on treatment was launched. Nikshay Poshan Yojana ensure that the patients have economic support and nutrition during the required period.</li>
<li><strong>TB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign</strong>: was launched to accelerate the efforts to end TB by 2025. The campaign aims to initiate preventive and promotive health approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Community-led approach</strong>: By applying “multi-sectoral and community-led” approach, the government is building a national movement to end TB by 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Ni-kshay Mitra:</strong> Any individual or organisation can register as Ni-kshay Mitra on the Ni-kshay 2.0 portal to support people affected by the disease. The initiative intends to provide essential nutritional and social support to people with TB and root out stigma and discrimination against them.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Some positive suggestions to eliminate TB</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sincere efforts need to be made to make our health systems more accessible and reliable.</li>
<li>It also required to ensure that those seeking care trust the healthcare system and get the appropriate care for completing treatment.</li>
<li>There is a need to create more labs, point of care tests, an assured drug pipeline, access to new drugs.</li>
<li>The government should also ensure counselling and support for those affected.</li>
<li>Every patient who is diagnosed late and does not receive timely treatment continues to infect others.</li>
<li>To break this cycle, government machinery at the field level should work with communities and provide free diagnosis and treatment to every affected individual.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>We have ignored TB for too long. It’s time we acknowledge the magnitude of the disease, and work harder at offering individuals equitable healthcare access and resources that the disease warrants.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Do you think we can eliminate TB by 2025? Discuss the roadmap and give some affirmative actions to be taken by government.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Japanese scientists have devised a system that can create cyborg cockroaches that are part insect and part machine.</p>
<h4>Cyborg cockroaches</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cyborg cockroaches’ movements are controlled by tiny integrated circuits.</li>
<li>They will be able to conduct surveillance in procedures like urban search and rescue, environmental monitoring and inspection of areas dangerous to humans.</li>
<li>By equipping the cockroaches with small wireless control modules, handlers will be able to control the insect’s legs remotely for long periods of time.</li>
<li>The team used Madagascar cockroaches, which are not only the largest species of cockroaches, reaching an estimated 6 cm, but are also known for making hissing sounds when disturbed, which they make by expelling air from the openings on their back.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How is it powered?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The researchers also designed the system to be rechargeable, by powering it with a super thin 0.004 mm solar cell module that is installed on the dorsal side of the cockroach’s abdomen.</li>
<li>This was done to ensure that the battery remains charged and the cockroach can be controlled for long periods of time, while simultaneously ensuring that the movement remains unhindered.</li>

<p>Indian Railways had successfully completed trials of the second generation Vande Bharat train that will come with enhanced passenger comfort and safety features.</p>
<h4>What is Vande Bharat Express?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Vande Bharat Express is a semi-high-speed train designed, developed, and built by the <strong>Integral Coach Factory (ICF).</strong></li>
<li>Presently there are only <strong>two Vande Bharat trains</strong> that are running — <em>Delhi to Varanasi and Delhi to Katra.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>The current Vande Bharat trains have <strong><u>seating only in two classes</u></strong> — chair car and executive chair car. But Railways is planning to upgrade it.</li>
<li>The trains have fully <strong><u>sealed gangways for a dust-free environment</u></strong>, modular bio-vacuum toilets, rotating seats in Executive Class, personalized reading lights, automatic entry/exit doors with sliding footsteps, diffused LED lighting, mini pantry, and sensor-based interconnecting doors in each coach.</li>
<li>They are <strong><u>self-propelled trains</u></strong> that do not require an engine. This feature is called a <strong>distributed traction power system</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of Vande Bharat Trains</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cuts Travel Time Drastically</li>
<li>Energy Efficient</li>
<li>Reduce Turnaround Time</li>
<li>Faster Acceleration and Deceleration among others.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Vice President has released the Arabic Version of “Majma Ul-Bahrain” of Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The course of the history of the Indian subcontinent, had Dara Shikoh prevailed over Aurangzeb, has been a matter of some conjecture among historians. Critically analyse.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4>Who was Dara Shikoh?</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/who-was-dara-shikoh-1615-1659/">Dara Shikoh</a>, who was Mughal emperor Shah Jahan’s son and expected heir, was killed on the orders of his brother Aurangzeb in 1659 after losing the war of succession.</li>
<li>He was the eldest son and heir-apparent of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.</li>
<li>Dara was designated with the title Padshahzada-i-Buzurg Martaba (Prince of High Rank) and was favored as a successor by his father and his older sister, Princess Jahanara Begum.</li>
<li>In the war of succession which ensued after Shah Jahan’s illness in 1657, Dara was defeated by his younger brother Prince Muhiuddin (Aurangzeb).</li>
<li>He was executed in 1659 on Aurangzeb’s orders in a bitter struggle for the imperial throne.</li>
</ul>
<h4>His legacy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dara was a liberal-minded unorthodox Muslim as opposed to the orthodox Aurangzeb.</li>
<li>He authored the work Majma Ul-Bahrain (The Confluence of the Two Seas), which argues for the harmony of Sufi philosophy in Islam and Vedanta philosophy in Hinduism.</li>
<li>It was Dara Shikoh who was responsible for making the Upanishads available to the West as he had them translated.</li>
<li>He had commissioned a translation of Yoga Vasistha.</li>
<li>A great patron of the arts, he was also more inclined towards philosophy and mysticism rather than military pursuits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He translated the Upanishads and other important works from Sanskrit to Persian. He was convinced that the Upanishads are what the Qur’an calls ‘Al-Kitab Al-Maknoun’ (The Hidden book).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="n4s"><div class="heading">Note4Students</div><div class="content"><p>From UPSC perspective, the following things are important : </p><p><strong>Prelims level : </strong>Places of Worship Act</p><p><strong>Mains level : </strong>Issues with the Act</p></div></div><p>The Supreme Court has set the ball rolling on a series of petitions challenging the validity of the <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/what-is-the-places-of-worship-act/">Places of Worship Act of 1991</a>, a parliamentary law that protects the identity and character of religious places as on August 15, 1947.</p>
<h4>What are the petitions about?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A slew of petitions has been filed against the Act.</li>
<li>The Act has fixed a retrospective cut-off date illegally barring Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs from approaching courts to re-claim their places of worship which were invaded and encroached.</li>
<li>The main objective of these petitions is to set right a historical wrong committed by barbaric invaders.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Places of Worship Act, 1991</h4>
<ul>
<li>It was passed in 1991 by the P V Narasimha Rao-led government.</li>
<li>The law seeks to maintain the “religious character” of places of worship as it was in 1947 — except in the case of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, which was already in court.</li>
<li>The law was brought in at the peak of the Ram Mandir movement, exactly a year before the demolition of the Babri Masjid.</li>
<li>Introducing the law, then Home Minister S B Chavan said in Parliament that it was adopted to curb communal tension.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are its provisions?</p>
<h4>What are its provisions?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-conversion:</strong> Section 3 of the Act bars the conversion, in full or part, of a place of worship of any religious denomination into a place of worship of a different religious denomination — or even a different segment of the same religious denomination.</li>
<li><strong>Holiness of a place:</strong> Section 4(1) declares that the religious character of a place of worship “shall continue to be the same as it existed” on August 15, 1947.</li>
<li><strong>Litigation:</strong> Section 4(2) says any suit or legal proceeding with respect to the conversion of the religious character of any place existing on August 15, 1947, pending before any court, shall abate — and no fresh suit or legal proceedings shall be instituted.</li>
<li><strong>Exception for Ayodhya:</strong> Section 5 stipulates that the Act shall not apply to the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case, and to any suit, appeal or proceeding relating to it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is the law under challenge?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><u>cut-off date of August 15, 1947, is “arbitrary, irrational and retrospective</u></strong>” and prohibits Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs from approaching courts to “reclaim” their places of worship.</li>
<li>Such places, he argued, were “<strong><u>invaded” and “encroached” upon by “fundamentalist barbaric invaders</u></strong>”.</li>
<li>The right-wing politicians have opposed the law even when it was introduced, arguing that the Centre has no power to legislate on “pilgrimages” or “burial grounds” which is under the state list.</li>
<li>Another criticism against the law is that the cut-off is the date of Independence, which means that the status quo determined by a colonial power is considered final.</li>
</ul>

<p>The expert committee formed by the Uttarakhand government to examine ways for the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has launched a website, seeking public opinion on the plan.</p>
<h4><strong>What is a Uniform Civil Code?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/sansad-tv-perspective-uniform-civil-code/">Uniform Civil Code</a> (UCC) is one that would provide for <strong><u>one personal civil law for the entire country</u></strong>.</li>
<li>This would be <strong><u>applicable to all religious communities</u></strong> in their personal matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Basis for Uniform Civil Code<br/>
</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Article 44</u></strong>, one of the <strong><u>Directive Principles</u></strong> of the Constitution lays down that the state shall endeavour to secure a UCC for the citizens throughout the territory of India.</li>
<li>These, as defined in <strong><u>Article 37</u></strong>, <strong>are not justiciable</strong> (<strong><u>not enforceable by any court</u></strong>) but the principles laid down therein are fundamental in governance.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Personal Laws And Uniform Civil Code: Timeline</strong></h4>
<p><strong># British period<br/>
</strong>During the British Raj, Personal laws were first framed mainly for Hindu and Muslims citizens.</p>
<p><strong># Start of 20th Century</strong><br/>
In the beginning of the twentieth century, the demand for a uniform civil code was first put forward by the women activists. The objective behind this demand was the women’s rights, equality and secularism.</p>
<p><strong># 1940 – The Idea of Uniform Civil Code is born</strong><br/>
The idea of Uniform Civil Code was tabled by the National Planning Commission (NPC) appointed by the Congress. There was a subcommittee who was to examine women’s status and recommends reforms of personal law for gender equality.</p>
<p><strong># 1947 – Question of UCC as a Fundamental Right<br/>
</strong>UCC was sought to be enshrined in the Constitution of India as a fundamental right by Minoo Masani, Hansa Mehta, Amrit Kaur and Dr. B.R Ambedkar.</p>
<p><strong># 1948 – Constitution Assembly debated UCC</strong><br/>
Article 44 of the Indian Constitution i.e. Directive Principles of State Policy sets implementation of uniform civil laws which is the duty of the state under Part IV.</p>
<p><strong># 1950 – Reformist Bill passed</strong><br/>
Reformist bills were passed which gave the Hindu women the right to divorce and inherit property. Bigamy and child marriages are outlawed. Such reforms were resisted by Dr. Rajendra Prasad.</p>
<p><strong># 1951 – Dr. Ambedkar Resigns</strong><br/>
Dr. Ambedkar resigned from the cabinet in 1951 when his draft of the Hindu Code Bill was stalled by the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong># 1985 – Shah Bano Case</strong><br/>
In this case, a divorced Muslim woman was brought within the ambit of Section 125 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the Supreme Court in which it was declared by the Apex court that she was entitled for maintenance even after the completion ofiddatperiod.</p>
<p><strong># 1995- Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India<br/>
</strong>In this case, Justice Kuldip Singh reiterated the need for the Parliament to frame a Uniform Civil Code, which would help the cause of national integration by removing contradictions based on ideologies. Therefore, the responsibility entrusted on the State under Article 44 of the Constitution whereby a Uniform Civil Code must be secured has been urged by the Supreme Court repeatedly as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong># 2000 – Supreme Court advocates UCC<br/>
</strong>The case of Lily Thomas v. Union of India (2000),where the Supreme Court said it could not direct the centre to introduce a UCC.</p>
<p><strong># 2015 – The Debate lives through</strong><br/>
The apex court refused to direct the government to take a decision on having a UCC.</p>
<p><strong># 2016 – Triple Talaq Debate<br/>
</strong>When PM asked the Law Commission to examine the issue.</p>
<p><strong># 2017 – Ruling of the Triple Talaq case</strong><br/>
Triple Talaq (Talaq -e- biddat) was declared unconstitutional on August 22, 2017.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>UCC vs. Right to Freedom of Religion</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Article 25</u></strong> lays down an individual’s fundamental right to religion</li>
<li><strong><u>Article 26(b)</u></strong> upholds the right of each religious denomination or any section thereof to “manage its own affairs in matters of religion”</li>
<li><strong><u>Article 29</u></strong> defines the right to conserve distinctive culture</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Reasonable restrictions on the Freedom of Religion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An individual’s freedom of religion under <strong><u>Article 25 is</u></strong> <strong>subject to “public order, health, morality”</strong> and other provisions relating to FRs, but a group’s freedom under Article 26 has not been subjected to other FRs.</li>
<li>In the Constituent Assembly, there was division on the issue of putting UCC in the fundamental rights chapter. The matter was settled by a vote.</li>
<li>By a 5:4 majority, the fundamental rights sub-committee headed by Sardar Patel held that the provision was outside the scope of FRs and therefore the UCC was made less important.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Minority Opinion in the Constituent Assembly</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Some members sought to <strong><u>immunize Muslim Personal Law from state regulation</u></strong>.</li>
<li>Mohammed Ismail, who thrice tried unsuccessfully to get Muslim Personal Law exempted from Article 44, said <strong><u>a secular state should not interfere with the personal law of people</u></strong>.</li>
<li>B Pocker Saheb said he had received representations against a common civil code from various organisations, including Hindu organisations.</li>
<li>Hussain Imam questioned <strong><u>whether there could ever be uniformity of personal laws in a diverse country like India.</u></strong></li>
<li>B R Ambedkar said “no government can use its provisions in a way that would force the Muslims to revolt”.</li>
<li>Alladi Krishnaswami, who was in favour of a UCC, conceded that it would be unwise to enact UCC ignoring strong opposition from any community.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>Gender justice was never discussed in these debates.</u></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Enacting and Enforcing UCC</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental rights are enforceable in a court of law.</li>
<li>While Article 44 uses the words “state shall endeavour”, other Articles in the ‘Directive Principles’ chapter use words such as “in particular strive”; “shall in particular direct its policy”; “shall be obligation of the state” etc.</li>
<li>Article 43 mentions “state shall endeavour by suitable legislation” while the phrase “by suitable legislation” is absent in Article 44.</li>
<li>All this implies that <strong><u>the duty of the state is greater in other directive principles than in Article 44</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What are more important — fundamental rights or directive principles?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There is no doubt that <strong><u>fundamental rights are more important</u></strong>.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court held in Minerva Mills (1980): Indian Constitution is founded on the bed-rock of the balance between Parts III (Fundamental Rights) and IV (Directive Principles).</li>
<li>To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to disturb the harmony of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Article 31C inserted by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, however, lays down that if a law is made to implement any directive principle, it cannot be challenged on the ground of being violative of the FRs under Articles 14 and 19.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What about Personal Laws?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Citizens belonging to different religions and denominations follow different property and matrimonial laws which <strong><u>are an affront to the nation’s unity</u></strong>.</li>
<li>If the framers of the Constitution had intended to have a UCC, they would have given exclusive jurisdiction to Parliament in respect of personal laws, by including this subject in the Union List.</li>
<li><strong><u>“Personal Laws” are mentioned in the Concurrent List.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Various customary laws</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>All Hindus of the country are not governed by one law, nor are all Muslims or all Christians.</li>
<li>Muslims of Kashmir were governed by a customary law, which in many ways was at variance with Muslim Personal Law in the rest of the country and was, in fact, closer to Hindu law.</li>
<li>Even on the registration of marriage among Muslims, laws differ from place to place.</li>
<li>In the Northeast, there are more than 200 tribes with their own varied customary laws.</li>
<li>The Constitution itself protects local customs in Nagaland. Similar protections are enjoyed by Meghalaya and Mizoram.</li>
<li>Even reformed Hindu law, in spite of codification, protects customary practices.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong> Why need UCC?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>UCC would provide <strong><u>equal status to all citizens</u></strong></li>
<li>It would promote <strong><u>gender parity</u></strong> in Indian society.</li>
<li>UCC would accommodate the <strong><u>aspirations of the young population</u></strong> who imbibe liberal ideology.</li>
<li>Its implementation would thus support the <strong><u>national integration</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Hurdles to UCC implementation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>There are practical difficulties due to <strong><u>religious and cultural diversity</u></strong> in India.</li>
<li>The UCC is often perceived by minorities as an <strong><u>encroachment of religious freedom.</u></strong></li>
<li>It is often regarded as <strong><u>interference of the state in personal matters</u></strong> of the minorities.</li>
<li>Experts often argue that the <strong><u>time is not ripe for Indian society</u></strong> to embrace such UCC.</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions need to be addressed which are being completely ignored in the present din around UCC.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, how can uniformity in personal laws are brought without disturbing the distinct essence of each and every component of the society.</li>
<li>Secondly, what makes us believe that practices of one community are backward and unjust?</li>
<li>Thirdly, has other uniformities been able to eradicate inequalities that diminish the status of our society as a whole?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Way forward</h4>
<ul>
<li>It should be the duty of the religious intelligentia to educate the community about its rights and obligations based on modern liberal interpretations.</li>
<li>A good environment for the UCC must be prepared by the government by explaining the contents and significance of Article 44 taking all into confidence.</li>
<li>Social reforms are not overnight but gradual phenomena. They are often vulnerable to media evils such as fake news and disinformation.</li>
<li>Social harmony and the cultural fabric of our nation must be the priority.</li>
</ul>

<p>A new study shows that a decline in <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/in-news-continental-drift-theory/">continental plate movement</a> likely controlled the onset and duration of many of the major volcanic events throughout Earth’s history.</p>
<h4>Why is the news?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Previous studies have linked major volcanic eruptions with past mass extinctions and disturbances in the global climatic, environmental and the carbon cycle.</li>
<li>Large igneous province volcanism, formations due to major volcanic eruptions occurring throughout Earth’s history, released large quantities of greenhouse gasses and toxic compounds into the atmosphere.</li>
<li>The sea warmed up by 4°C to 10°C, even at low- to mid-latitudes, the study noted.</li>
<li>Increased acidic levels and a lack of oxygen drove major ocean extinctions.</li>
<li>Large-scale volcanism took place in southern Africa, Antarctica and Australia. This is known as the Karoo-Ferrar Large Igneous Province.</li>
</ul>
<h4>About Karoo-Ferrar Large Igneous Province</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Karoo and Ferrar Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are two large igneous provinces in Southern Africa and Antarctica respectively, collectively known as the Karoo-Ferrar, Gondwana, or Southeast African LIP associated with the initial break-up of the Gondwana supercontinent.</li>
<li>Its flood basalt mostly covers South Africa and Antarctica but portions extend further into southern Africa and into South America, India, Australia and New Zealand.</li>
<li>Karoo-Ferrar formed just prior to the breakup of Gondwana in the Lower Jurassic epoch, about 183 million years ago.</li>
<li>This time corresponds to the early Toarcian anoxic event and the Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction.</li>
</ul>

<p>PM Modi will travel to Samarkand in Uzbekistan to attend the first in-person summit of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) countries since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h4>What is SCO?</h4>
<ul>
<li>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the then security and economic architecture in the Eurasian region dissolved and new structures had to come up.</li>
<li>The original Shanghai Five were China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan.</li>
<li>The SCO was formed in 2001, with Uzbekistan included. It expanded in 2017 to include India and Pakistan.</li>
<li>Since its formation, the SCO has focused on regional non-traditional security, with counter-terrorism as a priority.</li>
<li>The fight against the “three evils” of terrorism, separatism and extremism has become its mantra. Today, areas of cooperation include themes such as economics and culture.</li>
</ul>
<h4>India’s entry to the SCO</h4>
<ul>
<li>India and Pakistan both were observer countries.</li>
<li>While Central Asian countries and China were not in favor of expansion initially, the main supporter — of India’s entry in particular — was Russia.</li>
<li>A widely held view is that Russia’s growing unease about an increasingly powerful China prompted it to push for its expansion.</li>
<li>From 2009 onwards, Russia officially supported India’s ambition to join the SCO in 2017.</li>
<li>China then asked for its all-weather friend Pakistan’s entry.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changing the narrative of SCO</h4>
<p><img alt="sco" class="wp-image-635037 aligncenter" height="775" loading="lazy" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sco-125x300.jpg" width="323"/></p>
<ul>
<li>There has been discussion in the international arena that the trend of non-alignment is back.</li>
<li>NATO is based on Cold War thinking.</li>
<li>The logic of NATO is creating new enemies to sustain its own existence.</li>
<li>However, SCO is a cooperative organisation based on non-alignment and not targeting a third party.</li>
</ul>
<h4>India and SCO: Present status</h4>
<ul>
<li>India will host the SCO summit next year, and Varanasi has been selected as the SCO region’s first “Tourism and Cultural Capital”.</li>
<li>India will also be chairing the summit.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The increasing cost of production and the increase in GST on apple cartons has triggered protests in Himachal Pradesh’s apple farmers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the issue?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The cost of production of agricultural items increased substantially, denying remunerative prices to the poor and marginal apple farmers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reason for crisis in apple farming</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase in cost of production: </strong>The input cost of fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides has risen in the last decade by 300%, as per some estimates. The cost of apple cartons and trays and packaging has also seen a dramatic rise. In the last decade, the cost of a carton, for instance, has risen from about ₹30 to ₹ The cost borne to market the Produce has also risen.</li>
<li><strong>High taxation: </strong>The increase in the Goods and Services Tax on cartons from 12% to 18%. This was done to ensure that farmers are forced to sell their produce to big buyers instead of selling it in the open market. Just as the three farm laws were designed on the pretext of getting rid of the middlemen, the argument here was that commission agents, who fleece the apple farmers, will be forced to exit the picture. But this leaves the apple growers at the mercy of large giants in procurement, who have precedence of even deciding the procurement price.</li>
<li><strong>No MSP in Himachal: </strong>Unlike in Jammu and Kashmir, where there is a minimum rate for procurement, there is no such law in Himachal. The government also does not seem prepared to bring in such a law. The farmers are demanding that legally guaranteed procurement at a <a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/news/back-in-news-minimum-support-price-msp/">Minimum Support Price</a> (C2+50%) should be ensured to improve apple farmers condition.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="apple farmers" class="alignnone wp-image-634928" height="366" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2021_3largeimg_782680985-300x199.jpeg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2021_3largeimg_782680985-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2021_3largeimg_782680985.jpeg 660w" width="552"/>How to address this issue?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need for a regulator: </strong>What is required is an independent body that is duly supported and trusted by the farmers. Such a body should have representatives of apple growers, market players, commission agents and the government. This must be a statutory body that is also given the task of conducting research in the apple economy.</li>
<li><strong>Directional efforts: </strong>Issues such as high input cost, lack of fair price and unavailability of infrastructure such as cold chains should be addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Required research to support improvements in apple farming systems</strong>: Over the past few decades, the priorities in research projects and government policies on apple production were focused on the improvement of tree productivity and product quality. This was important to enhance the net incomes and living standards of apple producers in India. This research should be further enhanced by introducing European varieties in India.</li>
<li><strong>Focussing on Alternative Market Channels: </strong>The alternative market channel works on the principles of decentralisation and direct-to-home delivery. The idea is to create smaller, less congested markets in urban areas with the participation of farmers’ groups and Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) so that farmers have direct access to consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Logistics transformation: </strong>To sustain the demand for agricultural commodities, investments in key logistics must be enhanced. Moreover, e-commerce and delivery companies and start-ups need to be encouraged with suitable policies and incentives. The small and medium enterprises, running with raw materials from the agriculture and allied sector or otherwise, also need special attention so that the rural economy doesn’t collapse.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="apple farmers" class="alignnone wp-image-634929" height="333" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple1-1598518281-lb-300x172.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple1-1598518281-lb-300x172.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple1-1598518281-lb.jpg 740w" width="581"/>Conclusion </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture is dying, not as in the production of food but as a desirable profession. One bad yield, whether due to errant rains, pests, etc., and most farmers have no buffer available. The last point worth considering is that food and agriculture are not the same. Expenditures on food span the value-add, including processing, preparation, service in restaurants, etc. Farmers in India merely get paid for their product and not for the food we eat.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mains question </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. Do you think there is urgent need to extend MSP to horticulture sector also? Discuss what can be done to solve the apple farmer crisis in Himachal Pradesh.</strong></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Recent events of targeted killings of Kashmiri pandits and other Hindus by the militants in the valley lead to the protests which once again brought forward the question of their right to return and the safety of minorities living in the valley</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Who are the Kashmiri pandits?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Kashmiri Pandits are one of the highest ranked Brahman castes who are the natives of the valley, locally known as pundits.</li>
<li>They were the minority in the valley comprising only 5% of the total population.</li>
<li>Traditionally dependent on agriculture and small-scale business and one of the favored sections in the administration.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.civilsdaily.com/burning-issue-kashmiri-pandit-exodus/"><strong>What is the conflict?</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Radical Islamists and militants started targeting the Kashmiri pundits putting in front the option of either of conversion or persecution.</li>
<li>The Growth of militancy in the 1990s forced Kashmiri pandits to leave the valley in greater numbers. They started migrating to the other states, leaving every belonging behind and seeking refuge in other parts.</li>
<li>While many of them started migrating some decided to stay back in their homeland.</li>
<li>Conflict arose between radical Islamists organization and the Hindus leading to the mass killings of the Kashmiri Hindus in waves which is termed as exodus.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>After the Pandit exodus from the Valley in the 1990s, the first few years of this century saw government efforts to send Pandits back to the Valley.</li>
<li>Under the Prime Minister’s return and rehabilitation of Kashmir migrants scheme, created government postings in the Valley for Kashmiri Pandit “migrant” youth.</li>
<li>Mostly, teachers and these government employees have lived in protected high security enclaves, but their work requires them to leave these enclaves and mingle with the rest of the population. Another segment, known as “non-migrant” Pandits because they never left the Valley, has lived in their own homes, without state-provided protection.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is CDR?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Centre for dialogue and reconciliation (CDR) is a Delhi-based think-tank incorporated in March 2001, aims to be a catalyst for peace in South Asia.</li>
<li>CDR working for the peace-building process in Jammu Kashmir, supported the initiative of dialogue between the two communities as a part of self-assessment, acknowledging the mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><img alt="kashmiri pandits" class="alignnone wp-image-634947" height="324" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" src="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kashmiri-pandits-pti2-1654090920-300x192.jpg" srcset="https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kashmiri-pandits-pti2-1654090920-300x192.jpg 300w, https://d18x2uyjeekruj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kashmiri-pandits-pti2-1654090920.jpg 715w" width="506"/>What did CDR do in Kashmir?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>CDR supported the initiative for a dialogue proposed by two prominent young Kashmiris one a Muslim and the other a Pandit both who have witnessed the violence of 1990 and the subsequent years.</li>
<li>They believe in the principle of talking could lead to healing.</li>
<li>It led to CDR’s ‘Shared Witness’, a Pandit-Muslim dialogue series, in December 2010.</li>
<li>Public intellectuals and other influential persons from both communities were participants</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Observations of the dialogue </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The dialogue series coincided with the launching of the Prime Minister’s job scheme.</li>
<li>Dialogues created a social environment that enabled Kashmiri Pandits to take up government postings in the Valley.</li>
<li>They focused on the events in and around 1990, and the incidents that triggered the displacement of the Pandit community.</li>
<li>By the third dialogue, participants were sharing individual experiences that did not fit into the narrative that each community had built about the other.</li>
<li>The process of the conversation lead them to think on the actual reason behind the conflict, was it communal differences, or was it only religion?</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>From the eyes of the pandits</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Pandits were aggrieved that the Muslims did not protest the Pandit killings, not even when the killers claimed them. That greater responsibility lay with the Muslims as they were the majority.</li>
<li>If some social organizations had acted quickly, the exodus could have been stopped.</li>
<li>They observed that the Pandit community too had suffered from a lack of leadership.</li>
<li>They demand an apology and to set up of possible “Truth commission”</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What do the Muslims say?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Muslim participants felt the Pandits were in denial of the struggle of the Muslims in the Valley, who were facing violence from the system.</li>
<li>The Kashmiri Muslim was always portrayed as being misguided, aided, and abetted by Pakistan.</li>
<li>The protest in Kashmir was not against religion but against structures of power and oppression.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is the Current situation?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The fresh spate of targeted killings of Kashmir pandits created an environment of fear and provided a major setback to their rehabilitation in the Kashmir valley.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Way ahead:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>We need urgent civil society engagement between communities in Kashmir once again.</li>
<li>The government can enable it, but individuals and civil society will need to create conditions on the ground. They will have to encourage people to give up the blame game.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Tourism boosts the revenue of the economy, creates thousands of jobs, develops the infrastructures of a country, and plants a sense of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why tourism is needed?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tourism is not a fad. It is a compulsion driven by the urge to discover new places. Because we have this compulsion to venture into the unknown, we need each other. When humans travel, meet and exchange ideas, civilisation flourishes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What should be done to promote tourism?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Tourism Authority</strong>: A separate National Tourism Authority (NTA) should be established for executing and operationalizing various tourism related initiatives. Simple, flexible and elegant processes will be laid down to allow for nimbleness.</li>
<li><strong>National Tourism Advisory Board</strong>: A National Tourism Advisory Board (NTAB) should be set up to provide overall vision, guidance and direction to the Development of Tourism Sector in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Synergy in Tourism Eco System</strong>: In order to ensure synergy at various levels of Government and with the Private Sector, it is important to have a well-defined framework in place.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Tourism Framework</strong>: A robust framework for quality certification of products and services across all segments like accommodation providers, tour operators, adventure tour operators, service providers like spa and wellness, guides, restaurants etc. should be laid down.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing the existing luxury tourism products:</strong> The existing tourism products such as Nilgiri Mountain Railway, Palace on Wheels etc. should be enhanced and their numbers will also be increased. Haulage charges will be rationalised to make luxury trains viable.</li>
<li><strong>Railways can be a game changer:</strong> For tourism Railways have presence in most parts of the country. Most of the tourist destinations in the country are connected by rail. Railways is also in the process of connecting more places especially the strategic locations that also are tourist places with limited connectivity at present. Indian Railways is working towards promoting tourism in the country by operating more trains connecting tourists’ destinations and also by providing an array of products starting from luxury tourist trains to budget catering tourist trains</li>
